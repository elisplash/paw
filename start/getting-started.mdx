# What is Pawz?

Pawz is a **native desktop AI agent platform** built on [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/). It gives you a standalone app where you can create AI agents, connect them to chat platforms, and let them work autonomously — all without opening a terminal or editing config files.

## How it works

```
┌──────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Pawz Desktop UI     │          │  Rust Backend Engine         │
│  (TypeScript)        │◄── IPC ──►  Agent loop + tool executor  │
│                      │          │  11 channel bridges          │
│  20+ views           │          │  10 AI providers             │
│  Material Symbols    │          │  SQLite + OS keychain        │
└──────────────────────┘          └──────────────────────────────┘
```

Everything runs locally on your machine through Tauri IPC — no open ports, no Node.js backend, no cloud dependency.
