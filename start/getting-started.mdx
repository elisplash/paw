## What is OpenPawz?

OpenPawz is the **open-source AI agent operating system** for your desktop. It's not a chatbot. It's not a wrapper around an API. It's a full-blown, multi-agent platform that runs natively on your machine — with zero cloud dependency.

**Imagine this:** You have autonomous AI agents with unique personalities, long-term memory, and access to **25,000+ integrations** — managing Notion boards, Slack channels, GitHub repos, email, trading crypto on three chains, voicing responses aloud, monitoring infrastructure, controlling smart home devices, researching the web, deploying to AWS, writing content, and responding to messages across **11 chat platforms simultaneously**. 400+ integrations ship built-in, and 25,000+ more are available via the embedded n8n engine and MCP Bridge — agents discover and install them at runtime, on demand. Just configure credentials and go.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Who is it for?">
    **Everyone who's tired of walled-garden AI.** Developers who want to build and extend. Power users who want a personal AI army across every platform they use. Teams who need private, auditable AI that never phones home. If you've ever wished your AI could actually *do things* — not just talk — OpenPawz is what you've been waiting for.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="What's different?">
    Most AI tools give you a chat window. OpenPawz gives you an **agent operating system**:
    - **25,000+ integrations** — 400+ native built-in, plus 25,000+ community integrations via the MCP Bridge to n8n — all discoverable and auto-deployable at runtime
    - **11 channels at once** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, IRC, Twitch, and more
    - **Multi-agent orchestration** — Boss/worker delegation, agent squads, inter-agent messaging
    - **Multi-chain DeFi trading** — Coinbase + Solana (Jupiter/Pump.fun) + Ethereum (Uniswap) with policy guardrails
    - **Hybrid semantic memory** — BM25 + vector + MMR + temporal decay
    - **Voice** — Three TTS providers (Google, OpenAI, ElevenLabs) + speech-to-text
    - **Visual node editor** — Drag-and-drop workflow builder for agent pipelines
    - **Model routing** — Auto complexity-based routing + daily budget caps + thinking level control
    - **Self-improving agents** — Agents search PawzHub and install skills for themselves at runtime
    - **Remote access** — Tailscale mesh VPN + webhook server for triggering agents from anywhere
    - **10 AI providers** — Ollama (local), OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and more
    - **Zero cloud** — SQLite, OS keychain, AES-256-GCM encryption. No servers, no ports, no subscriptions
    - **Native performance** — Tauri v2 + Rust backend. Not Electron. 530 tests. Zero CVEs.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Why open source?">
    Because your AI shouldn't have a landlord. OpenPawz is **MIT licensed** — fork it, extend it, deploy it however you want. The codebase is transparent, auditable, and community-driven. No vendor lock-in. No surprise pricing changes. No "we updated our privacy policy" emails.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Requirements">
    A computer (macOS, Linux, or Windows), 5 minutes, and one of:
    - A **local model** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) — completely free, completely private
    - An **API key** from any supported provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.

    That's it. No Docker required. No databases to manage. No infrastructure to maintain.

## How it works

```mermaid actions={false}
graph LR
    A["Chat Apps\n(Telegram, Discord, Slack...)"] --> B["OpenPawz\n(Tauri Desktop App)"]
    B --> C["AI Providers\n(Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic...)"]
    B --> D["25,000+ Integrations\n(400 native + MCP Bridge)"]
    B --> E["MCP Bridge\n(Embedded n8n)"]
    B --> F["SQLite + Keychain\n(Local Storage)"]
```

The desktop app is the single source of truth for agents, sessions, routing, and channel connections. Everything communicates through **Tauri IPC** — no open ports, no HTTP servers.

## Memory that never forgets

Most AI tools forget everything between conversations. OpenPawz doesn't.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Semantic long-term memory" icon="brain">
    Every important fact, preference, and detail is automatically captured and stored with vector embeddings. When context is relevant, it's auto-recalled into the conversation — no manual prompting needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Palace" icon="building-columns">
    A dedicated interface to browse, search, edit, and manage everything your agents have learned. Full visibility into what your AI knows about you.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Tip>Agents share a memory namespace by default, so knowledge captured by one agent is available to all. You can also isolate memory per agent or per workspace.</Tip>

---

## Token savings with session compaction

Long conversations burn tokens fast. OpenPawz has a built-in solution: **automatic session compaction**.

When a conversation approaches the model's context window limit, OpenPawz:
1. **Summarizes** the older parts of the conversation into a compact digest
2. **Preserves** key facts and decisions in memory
3. **Archives** the full session for later reference
4. **Continues** the conversation seamlessly with the summary + memory context

<Note>This means your agents can run **indefinitely long conversations** without hitting context limits or losing important context — and you pay for fewer tokens in the process.</Note>

---

## Security you can actually trust

OpenPawz was designed from the ground up with a **zero-trust, local-first security model**.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="100% local — no data leaves your machine" icon="shield-halved">
    All conversations, memories, agent configs, and files stay on your hardware. No cloud sync, no telemetry, no analytics. The only outbound traffic is to AI providers you explicitly configure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="OS-level credential storage" icon="key">
    API keys and secrets are stored in your operating system's native keychain — macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service. Never in plain text. Never in a config file.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Command risk classification" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Every tool and shell command is rated on a 1–5 risk scale. High-risk operations (file deletion, system commands, network access) require explicit user confirmation before execution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sandboxed execution" icon="box">
    Run agent shell commands in isolated Docker containers with configurable resource limits, network policies, and filesystem restrictions. Agents can't touch your host system.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Per-agent policies" icon="lock">
    Control exactly what each agent can do — which tools it can access, which channels it can use, what risk level it's allowed to execute at. Full granular permission control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prompt injection defense" icon="shield">
    Built-in prompt injection detection analyzes incoming messages for manipulation attempts and flags suspicious content before it reaches your agents.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="TLS certificate pinning" icon="lock">
    Custom `rustls` config pinned to Mozilla root CAs only — OS trust store excluded. Even a compromised CA on the user's machine cannot intercept provider traffic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request signing & memory zeroing" icon="fingerprint">
    Every outbound AI request SHA-256 signed for tamper detection. API keys auto-zeroed from RAM on provider drop via `Zeroizing<String>`.
  </Card>
</Columns>
