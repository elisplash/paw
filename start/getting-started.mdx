## What is OpenPawz?

OpenPawz is the **open-source AI agent operating system** for your desktop. It's not a chatbot. It's not a wrapper around an API. It's a full-blown, multi-agent platform that runs natively on your machine — with zero cloud dependency.

**Imagine this:** You have autonomous AI agents with unique personalities, long-term memory, and access to 75+ tools — managing your emails, monitoring markets, researching the web, writing content, running shell commands, and responding to messages across **11 chat platforms simultaneously**. All from one app. All on your hardware. All under your control.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Who is it for?">
    **Everyone who's tired of walled-garden AI.** Developers who want to build and extend. Power users who want a personal AI army across every platform they use. Teams who need private, auditable AI that never phones home. If you've ever wished your AI could actually *do things* — not just talk — OpenPawz is what you've been waiting for.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="What's different?">
    Most AI tools give you a chat window. OpenPawz gives you an **agent runtime**:
    - **11 channels at once** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, IRC, Twitch, and more
    - **Multi-agent orchestration** — Boss agents delegate to specialists, run parallel research
    - **Semantic memory** — Auto-capture, auto-recall, vector search across all conversations
    - **75+ built-in tools** — Email, GitHub, trading, browser, shell, TTS — not plugins, *built in*
    - **MCP extensions** — Connect to any Model Context Protocol server
    - **10 AI providers** — Ollama (local), OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and more
    - **Zero cloud** — SQLite, OS keychain, Tauri IPC. No servers, no ports, no subscriptions
    - **Native performance** — Tauri v2 + Rust backend. Not Electron.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Why open source?">
    Because your AI shouldn't have a landlord. OpenPawz is **MIT licensed** — fork it, extend it, deploy it however you want. The codebase is transparent, auditable, and community-driven. No vendor lock-in. No surprise pricing changes. No "we updated our privacy policy" emails.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Requirements">
    A computer (macOS, Linux, or Windows), 5 minutes, and one of:
    - A **local model** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) — completely free, completely private
    - An **API key** from any supported provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.

    That's it. No Docker required. No databases to manage. No infrastructure to maintain.

## How it works

```mermaid actions={false}

    A["Chat Apps\n(Telegram, Discord, Slack...)"] --> B["OpenPawz\n(Tauri Desktop App)"]
    B --> C["AI Providers\n(Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic...)"]
    B --> D["75+ Built-in Tools"]
    B --> E["MCP Extensions"]

```

The desktop app is the single source of truth for agents, sessions, routing, and channel connections. Everything communicates through **Tauri IPC** — no open ports, no HTTP servers.

## Memory that never forgets

Most AI tools forget everything between conversations. OpenPawz doesn't.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Semantic long-term memory">
    Every important fact, preference, and detail is automatically captured and stored with vector embeddings. When context is relevant, it's auto-recalled into the conversation — no manual prompting needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Palace">
    A dedicated interface to browse, search, edit, and manage everything your agents have learned. Full visibility into what your AI knows about you.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Tip>Agents share a memory namespace by default, so knowledge captured by one agent is available to all. You can also isolate memory per agent or per workspace.</Tip>

---

## Token savings with session compaction

Long conversations burn tokens fast. OpenPawz has a built-in solution: **automatic session compaction**.

When a conversation approaches the model's context window limit, OpenPawz:
1. **Summarizes** the older parts of the conversation into a compact digest
2. **Preserves** key facts and decisions in memory
3. **Archives** the full session for later reference
4. **Continues** the conversation seamlessly with the summary + memory context

<Note>This means your agents can run **indefinitely long conversations** without hitting context limits or losing important context — and you pay for fewer tokens in the process.</Note>

## Security you can actually trust

OpenPawz was designed from the ground up with a **zero-trust, local-first security model**.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="100% local — no data leaves your machine">
    All conversations, memories, agent configs, and files stay on your hardware. No cloud sync, no telemetry, no analytics. The only outbound traffic is to AI providers you explicitly configure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="OS-level credential storage">
    API keys and secrets are stored in your operating system's native keychain — macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service. Never in plain text. Never in a config file.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Command risk classification">
    Every tool and shell command is rated on a 1–5 risk scale. High-risk operations (file deletion, system commands, network access) require explicit user confirmation before execution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sandboxed execution">
    Run agent shell commands in isolated Docker containers with configurable resource limits, network policies, and filesystem restrictions. Agents can't touch your host system.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Per-agent policies">
    Control exactly what each agent can do — which tools it can access, which channels it can use, what risk level it's allowed to execute at. Full granular permission control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prompt injection defense">
    Built-in prompt injection detection analyzes incoming messages for manipulation attempts and flags suspicious content before it reaches your agents.
  </Card>
</Columns>

    npm run tauri dev
    ```
    The app launches with the built-in UI. No separate backend needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a provider">
    Open **Settings → Models** and add an API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, or point to a local Ollama instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first agent">
    Go to **Agents → New Agent**, pick a model, and start chatting. Your agent is ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>
