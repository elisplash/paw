## What is OpenPawz?

OpenPawz is the **open-source AI agent operating system** for your desktop. It's not a chatbot. It's not a wrapper around an API. It's a full-blown, multi-agent platform that runs natively on your machine — with zero cloud dependency.

**Imagine this:** You have autonomous AI agents with unique personalities, long-term memory, and access to 75+ tools — managing your emails, monitoring markets, researching the web, writing content, running shell commands, and responding to messages across **11 chat platforms simultaneously**. All from one app. All on your hardware. All under your control.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Who is it for?">
    **Everyone who's tired of walled-garden AI.** Developers who want to build and extend. Power users who want a personal AI army across every platform they use. Teams who need private, auditable AI that never phones home. If you've ever wished your AI could actually *do things* — not just talk — OpenPawz is what you've been waiting for.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="What's different?">
    Most AI tools give you a chat window. OpenPawz gives you an **agent runtime**:
    - **11 channels at once** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, IRC, Twitch, and more
    - **Multi-agent orchestration** — Boss agents delegate to specialists, run parallel research
    - **Semantic memory** — Auto-capture, auto-recall, vector search across all conversations
    - **75+ built-in tools** — Email, GitHub, trading, browser, shell, TTS — not plugins, *built in*
    - **MCP extensions** — Connect to any Model Context Protocol server
    - **10 AI providers** — Ollama (local), OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and more
    - **Zero cloud** — SQLite, OS keychain, Tauri IPC. No servers, no ports, no subscriptions
    - **Native performance** — Tauri v2 + Rust backend. Not Electron.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Why open source?">
    Because your AI shouldn't have a landlord. OpenPawz is **MIT licensed** — fork it, extend it, deploy it however you want. The codebase is transparent, auditable, and community-driven. No vendor lock-in. No surprise pricing changes. No "we updated our privacy policy" emails.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Requirements">
    A computer (macOS, Linux, or Windows), 5 minutes, and one of:
    - A **local model** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) — completely free, completely private
    - An **API key** from any supported provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.

    That's it. No Docker required. No databases to manage. No infrastructure to maintain.
  </Tab>

## How it works

The desktop app is the single source of truth for agents, sessions, routing, and channel connections. Everything communicates through **Tauri IPC** — no open ports, no HTTP servers.
