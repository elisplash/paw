## What is OpenPawz?

OpenPawz is the **open-source AI agent operating system** for your desktop. It's not a chatbot. It's not a wrapper around an API. It's a full-blown, multi-agent platform that runs natively on your machine — with zero cloud dependency.

**Imagine this:** You have autonomous AI agents with unique personalities, long-term memory, and access to 75+ tools — managing your emails, monitoring markets, researching the web, writing content, running shell commands, and responding to messages across **11 chat platforms simultaneously**. All from one app. All on your hardware. All under your control.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who is it for?">
    **Everyone who's tired of walled-garden AI.** Developers who want to build and extend. Power users who want a personal AI army across every platform they use. Teams who need private, auditable AI that never phones home. If you've ever wished your AI could actually *do things* — not just talk — OpenPawz is what you've been waiting for.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What makes it different?">
    Most AI tools give you a chat window. OpenPawz gives you an **agent runtime**:
    - **11 channels at once** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, IRC, Twitch, and more. One agent, every platform.
    - **Multi-agent orchestration** — Boss agents delegate to specialist workers. Run parallel research. Coordinate across teams.
    - **Semantic memory** — Agents remember everything. Auto-capture, auto-recall, vector search across all conversations.
    - **75+ built-in tools** — Email, GitHub, trading, browser automation, shell, TTS, inter-agent comms — not plugins, *built in*.
    - **MCP extensions** — Connect to any Model Context Protocol server for unlimited capabilities.
    - **10 AI providers** — Ollama (local), OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, OpenRouter, and more. Switch per-agent.
    - **Zero cloud** — SQLite database, OS keychain for secrets, Tauri IPC internally. No servers, no ports, no subscriptions.
    - **Native performance** — Built on Tauri v2 with a Rust backend. Not Electron. Fast, lean, secure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why open source?">
    Because your AI shouldn't have a landlord. OpenPawz is **MIT licensed** — fork it, extend it, deploy it however you want. The codebase is transparent, auditable, and community-driven. No vendor lock-in. No surprise pricing changes. No "we updated our privacy policy" emails.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What do you need to get started?">
    A computer (macOS, Linux, or Windows), 5 minutes, and one of:
    - A **local model** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) — completely free, completely private
    - An **API key** from any supported provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.

    That's it. No Docker required. No databases to manage. No infrastructure to maintain.
  </Accordion>

## How it works

```mermaid actions={false}

    A["Chat Apps\n(Telegram, Discord, Slack...)"] --> B["OpenPawz\n(Tauri Desktop App)"]
    B --> C["AI Providers\n(Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic...)"]
    B --> D["75+ Built-in Tools"]
    B --> E["MCP Extensions"]
    B --> F["SQLite + Keychain\n(Local Storage)"]
```

The desktop app is the single source of truth for agents, sessions, routing, and channel connections. Everything communicates through **Tauri IPC** — no open ports, no HTTP servers.
