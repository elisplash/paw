## The AI agent platform you actually own

OpenPawz is an **open-source AI agent operating system** built on [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/). It's not another chatbot UI. It's a complete runtime for deploying, managing, and orchestrating autonomous AI agents — entirely on your desktop, with zero cloud dependency.

While other tools give you a text box and an API bill, OpenPawz gives you:

- **11 chat channels** running simultaneously — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, IRC, Twitch, Mattermost, Nextcloud, Nostr, and built-in Webchat
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — boss agents delegate to specialists, run parallel workflows, and coordinate across workspaces
- **75+ built-in tools** — email, GitHub, trading, browser automation, shell execution, TTS, file ops, and inter-agent messaging — not plugins, *built in*
- **Semantic long-term memory** — agents auto-capture and auto-recall facts across every conversation, forever
- **10 AI providers** — Ollama (free, local), OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, OpenRouter, Moonshot, plus any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Three-tier extensibility** — Skills (prompt injection), Integrations (custom tools), Extensions (full sidebar apps) — plus MCP for unlimited external tool servers
- **PawzHub marketplace** — discover and share community-built extensions
- **Native Rust performance** — not Electron, not a web app. Fast, lean, secure.

## Core philosophy

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Privacy first">
    All data stays on your machine. Credentials live in the OS keychain. No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home. The only network traffic is to the AI providers you explicitly configure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent-native">
    Not a chatbot wrapper — a full agent runtime with tool use, memory, task management, session compaction, and multi-agent delegation built in from day one.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open and extensible">
    MIT licensed. Three tiers of extensibility: Skills (prompt-only), Integrations (tools + commands), and Extensions (full sidebar views with storage). Plus MCP for any external tool server.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Desktop-grade">
    Built with Tauri v2 for native performance. No Electron bloat. Rust backend, TypeScript frontend, SQLite storage. Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
