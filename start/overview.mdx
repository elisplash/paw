## The AI agent platform you actually own

OpenPawz is an **open-source AI agent operating system** built on [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/). It's not another chatbot UI. It's a complete runtime for deploying, managing, and orchestrating autonomous AI agents — entirely on your desktop, with zero cloud dependency.

While other tools give you a text box and an API bill, OpenPawz gives you:

- **11 chat channels** running simultaneously — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, IRC, Twitch, Mattermost, Nextcloud, Nostr, and built-in Webchat
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — boss agents delegate to specialists, run parallel workflows, and coordinate across workspaces
- **75+ built-in tools** — email, GitHub, trading, browser automation, shell execution, TTS, file ops, and inter-agent messaging — not plugins, *built in*
- **Semantic long-term memory** — agents auto-capture and auto-recall facts across every conversation, forever
- **10 AI providers** — Ollama (free, local), OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, OpenRouter, Moonshot, plus any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Three-tier extensibility** — Skills (prompt injection), Integrations (custom tools), Extensions (full sidebar apps) — plus MCP for unlimited external tool servers
- **PawzHub marketplace** — discover and share community-built extensions
- **Native Rust performance** — not Electron, not a web app. Fast, lean, secure.
- **Intelligent memory** — semantic long-term memory with auto-capture, auto-recall, and a Memory Palace for full visibility
- **Token-saving session compaction** — automatic summarization keeps conversations running indefinitely without hitting context limits
- **Enterprise-grade security** — OS keychain for secrets, command risk classification, sandboxed execution, prompt injection defense, per-agent policies

## How it stacks up

| | **OpenPawz** | **ChatGPT / Claude** | **Other self-hosted** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runs locally** | 100% — your hardware, your data | No — cloud only | Sometimes |
| **Multi-channel** | 11 platforms simultaneously | Web/mobile only | 1–2 if any |
| **Multi-agent** | Full orchestrator with delegation | Single assistant | Rare |
| **Memory** | Semantic auto-recall across sessions | Per-conversation | Basic or none |
| **Tools** | 75+ built-in + unlimited via MCP | Limited plugins | Varies |
| **Extensibility** | 3 tiers + marketplace | None | Plugin-based |
| **Cost** | Free forever + your API keys | $20–200/mo subscription | Free |
| **Data ownership** | 100% local, OS keychain for secrets | Company-owned | Self-hosted |
| **Performance** | Native Tauri/Rust | Web app | Usually Electron |
| **Token efficiency** | Session compaction saves 40–60% on long chats | No optimization | None |
| **Security model** | Risk classification + sandboxing + prompt defense | Trust the provider | Basic |

## Memory, tokens & security

Three features that set OpenPawz apart from everything else:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Semantic memory">
    Your agents **never forget**. Every important fact, preference, and detail is automatically captured with vector embeddings and recalled when relevant.

    - **Auto-capture** — agents extract and store key information from every conversation
    - **Auto-recall** — relevant memories are injected into context before the agent responds
    - **Memory Palace** — browse, search, edit, and manage everything your agents know
    - **Shared or isolated** — agents share memory by default, or you can isolate per agent/workspace

    Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, your agents build up knowledge over weeks and months — and you can see and control every piece of it.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Token savings">
    Long conversations burn tokens. OpenPawz solves this with **automatic session compaction**:

    1. When a conversation nears the context limit, older parts are **summarized** into a compact digest
    2. Key facts and decisions are **preserved in memory** — nothing important is lost
    3. The full session is **archived** for later reference
    4. The conversation **continues seamlessly** with summary + memory context

    The result: agents can run **indefinitely long conversations** without hitting context limits, and you pay for significantly fewer tokens. Typical savings: **40–60% on long-running sessions**.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Security">
    OpenPawz was designed with a **zero-trust, local-first security model**:

    - **100% local** — no data leaves your machine. No cloud sync, no telemetry, no analytics
    - **OS keychain** — API keys stored in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service. Never plain text.
    - **Risk classification** — every tool rated 1–5 for risk. Dangerous operations require user confirmation.
    - **Container sandbox** — run agent shell commands in isolated Docker containers with resource limits
    - **Per-agent policies** — granular control over tools, channels, and risk levels per agent
    - **Prompt injection defense** — built-in detection flags manipulation attempts before they reach agents
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Core philosophy

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Privacy first">
    All data stays on your machine. Credentials live in the OS keychain. No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home. The only network traffic is to the AI providers you explicitly configure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent-native">
    Not a chatbot wrapper — a full agent runtime with tool use, memory, task management, session compaction, and multi-agent delegation built in from day one.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open and extensible">
    MIT licensed. Three tiers of extensibility: Skills (prompt-only), Integrations (tools + commands), and Extensions (full sidebar views with storage). Plus MCP for any external tool server.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Desktop-grade">
    Built with Tauri v2 for native performance. No Electron bloat. Rust backend, TypeScript frontend, SQLite storage. Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
  </Card>
