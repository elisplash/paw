## What is OpenPawz?

OpenPawz is a **native desktop AI agent platform** built on [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/). It runs entirely on your machine — no cloud, no open ports, no Node.js backend. You own the agents, the data, and the infrastructure.

It gives you:

- A **multi-channel gateway** — connect Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, IRC, and more from a single app
- A **multi-agent orchestrator** — create autonomous agents with distinct personalities, tools, and memory
- A **local-first architecture** — SQLite storage, OS keychain for secrets, Tauri IPC for internal comms
- A **plugin ecosystem** — 75+ built-in tools, MCP extensions, and a marketplace (PawzHub)

## Core philosophy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Privacy first">
    All data stays on your machine. Credentials live in the OS keychain. No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home. The only network traffic is to the AI providers you explicitly configure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent-native">
    Not a chatbot wrapper — a full agent runtime with tool use, memory, task management, session compaction, and multi-agent delegation built in from day one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Open and extensible">
    MIT licensed. Three tiers of extensibility: Skills (prompt-only), Integrations (tools + commands), and Extensions (full sidebar views with storage). Plus MCP support for connecting to any external tool server.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Desktop-grade">
    Built with Tauri v2 for native performance. No Electron bloat. Rust backend, TypeScript frontend, SQLite storage. Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
  </Accordion>
