<Note>
**OpenPawz is not a chatbot.** It's an AI agent operating system that runs on your desktop — with 25,000+ integrations via MCP bridge, 11 chat channels, multi-agent orchestration, and zero cloud dependency.
</Note>

## The AI agent OS you actually own

Built on [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/) with a Rust backend. While other tools give you a text box and an API bill, OpenPawz gives you a complete agent runtime:

## How it stacks up

| | **OpenPawz** | **ChatGPT / Claude** | **AutoGPT / CrewAI** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runs locally** | 100% — your hardware | No — cloud only | CLI / Python lib |
| **Desktop native** | Tauri/Rust | No | No |
| **Chat channels** | 11 simultaneous | Web/mobile only | 0 |
| **Multi-agent** | Boss/worker + squads | Single assistant | Yes (framework) |
| **Memory** | Hybrid BM25+vector+MMR+decay | Per-conversation | None / basic |
| **Built-in integrations** | 25,000+ (400 native + MCP bridge) | Limited plugins | ~15 / code-defined |
| **DeFi trading** | 3 chains | None | None |
| **Voice (TTS/STT)** | 3 providers | Voice mode only | None |
| **Extension marketplace** | 3 tiers + PawzHub | None | Plugin store / none |
| **Self-installing skills** | Agents install their own | No | No |

## The three pillars

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Memory">
    Your agents **never forget**. Every important fact is automatically captured with vector embeddings and recalled when relevant.

    - **Auto-capture** — agents extract key info from every conversation
    - **Auto-recall** — relevant memories injected into context before the agent responds
    - **Memory Palace** — browse, search, edit everything your agents know
    - **Hybrid retrieval** — BM25 + vector + MMR + temporal decay
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Token savings">
    **Automatic session compaction** — when conversations near the context limit, older parts are summarized. Key facts preserved in memory. Full session archived. 40–60% token savings on long sessions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Security">
    Zero-trust, local-first — **10 security layers**:
    - **100% local** — no data leaves your machine
    - **OS keychain** — credentials in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service
    - **Risk classification** — every tool rated 1–5. Dangerous ops require confirmation
    - **Container sandbox** — Docker isolation with resource limits
    - **Prompt injection defense** — dual implementation, 30+ detection patterns
    - **TLS certificate pinning** — Mozilla root CAs only, OS trust store excluded
    - **Request signing** — SHA-256 hash of every outbound AI request for tamper detection
    - **Memory zeroing** — API keys auto-zeroed from RAM on provider drop
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Core philosophy

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Privacy first" icon="shield-halved">
    All data stays on your machine. Credentials in the OS keychain. No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home. The only network traffic is to AI providers you explicitly configure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent-native" icon="robot">
    Not a chatbot wrapper — a full agent runtime with tool use, memory, tasks, compaction, trading, voice, and multi-agent delegation built in from day one.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open and extensible" icon="code-branch">
    MIT licensed. Three extensibility tiers — Skills, Integrations, Extensions — plus MCP and PawzHub. Agents install their own skills at runtime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Desktop-grade" icon="desktop">
    Tauri v2 for native performance. Rust backend, vanilla TypeScript frontend, SQLite storage. 530 tests. Zero CVEs. macOS, Linux, Windows.
  </Card>
