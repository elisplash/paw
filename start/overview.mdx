## The AI agent platform you actually own

OpenPawz is an **open-source AI agent operating system** built on [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/). It's not another chatbot UI. It's a complete runtime for deploying, managing, and orchestrating autonomous AI agents — entirely on your desktop, with zero cloud dependency.

While other tools give you a text box and an API bill, OpenPawz gives you:

- **11 chat channels** running simultaneously — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, IRC, Twitch, Mattermost, Nextcloud, Nostr, and built-in Webchat
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — boss/worker delegation, agent squads, inter-agent messaging, parallel workflows
- **75+ built-in tools** — email, GitHub, browser, shell, trading, voice, file ops, inter-agent messaging — not plugins, *built in*
- **Multi-chain DeFi trading** — Coinbase + Solana (Jupiter/Pump.fun) + Ethereum (Uniswap) with trading policy guardrails
- **Hybrid semantic memory** — BM25 + vector + MMR re-ranking + temporal decay. The most advanced retrieval system in any agent platform
- **Voice** — three TTS providers (Google, OpenAI, ElevenLabs) + speech-to-text. Agents speak and listen
- **Visual node editor** — drag-and-drop workflow builder for creating agent pipelines without code
- **10 AI providers** — Ollama (free, local), OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, OpenRouter, Moonshot, plus any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Model routing** — automatic complexity-based routing sends simple queries to cheap models, complex tasks to powerful ones
- **Three-tier extensibility** — Skills → Integrations → Extensions graduation path, plus MCP and PawzHub marketplace
- **Self-improving agents** — agents search PawzHub and install new skills for themselves at runtime
- **Native Rust performance** — Tauri v2, not Electron. 158 IPC commands. Zero-framework vanilla TypeScript frontend
- **Token-saving session compaction** — automatic summarization saves 40–60% on tokens. Plus daily budget caps and thinking level control
- **Remote access** — Tailscale mesh VPN and built-in webhook server for triggering agents from anywhere
- **Enterprise-grade security** — OS keychain, AES-256-GCM encryption, command risk classification, container sandbox, prompt injection defense, credential audit trail, filesystem sandboxing

## How it stacks up

| | **OpenPawz** | **ChatGPT / Claude** | **OpenClaw** | **AutoGPT / CrewAI** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Runs locally** | 100% — your hardware | No — cloud only | Cloud or self-host | CLI / Python lib |
| **Desktop native** | Tauri/Rust | No | Electron | No |
| **Chat channels** | 11 simultaneous | Web/mobile only | 1–2 | 0 |
| **Multi-agent** | Boss/worker + squads | Single assistant | Basic | Yes (framework) |
| **Memory** | Hybrid BM25+vector+MMR+decay | Per-conversation | Basic | None / basic |
| **Built-in tools** | 75+ | Limited plugins | ~20 | ~15 / code-defined |
| **DeFi trading** | 3 chains (Coinbase+Solana+ETH) | None | None | None |
| **Voice (TTS/STT)** | 3 providers | Voice mode only | None | None |
| **Extension marketplace** | 3 tiers + PawzHub | None | None | Plugin store / none |
| **Self-installing skills** | Agents install their own | No | No | No |
| **Visual node editor** | Built-in | No | No | No |

## Memory, tokens & security

The features that set OpenPawz apart from everything else:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Semantic memory">
    Your agents **never forget**. Every important fact, preference, and detail is automatically captured with vector embeddings and recalled when relevant.

    - **Auto-capture** — agents extract and store key information from every conversation
    - **Auto-recall** — relevant memories are injected into context before the agent responds
    - **Memory Palace** — browse, search, edit, and manage everything your agents know
    - **Shared or isolated** — agents share memory by default, or you can isolate per agent/workspace

    Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, your agents build up knowledge over weeks and months — and you can see and control every piece of it.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Token savings">
    Long conversations burn tokens. OpenPawz solves this with **automatic session compaction**:

    1. When a conversation nears the context limit, older parts are **summarized** into a compact digest
    2. Key facts and decisions are **preserved in memory** — nothing important is lost
    3. The full session is **archived** for later reference
    4. The conversation **continues seamlessly** with summary + memory context

    The result: agents can run **indefinitely long conversations** without hitting context limits, and you pay for significantly fewer tokens. Typical savings: **40–60% on long-running sessions**.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Security">
    OpenPawz was designed with a **zero-trust, local-first security model**:

    - **100% local** — no data leaves your machine. No cloud sync, no telemetry, no analytics
    - **OS keychain** — API keys stored in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service. Never plain text.
    - **Risk classification** — every tool rated 1–5 for risk. Dangerous operations require user confirmation.
    - **Container sandbox** — run agent shell commands in isolated Docker containers with resource limits
    - **Per-agent policies** — granular control over tools, channels, and risk levels per agent
    - **Prompt injection defense** — built-in detection flags manipulation attempts before they reach agents
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What exists like this? Nothing.

OpenPawz is the **first AI agent operating system** that combines multi-agent orchestration, 11 simultaneous chat channels, multi-chain DeFi trading, hybrid semantic memory, voice, a visual node editor, a three-tier extension marketplace with self-installing skills, and enterprise-grade security — in a single, native, open-source desktop application.

- **OpenClaw** gives you a web interface. OpenPawz gives you a native desktop app with 11 channels.
- **AutoGPT** gives you a single agent in a terminal. OpenPawz gives you an army of agents with squads.
- **CrewAI** gives you a Python framework. OpenPawz gives you a complete platform with UI, marketplace, and trading.
- **LangChain** gives you building blocks. OpenPawz gives you the finished building.
- **ChatGPT/Claude** give you a chatbox owned by a corporation. OpenPawz gives you the whole thing — MIT licensed, on your hardware.

## Core philosophy

  </Card>
  <Card title="Open and extensible">
    MIT licensed. Three tiers of extensibility — Skills, Integrations, Extensions — plus MCP and PawzHub marketplace. Agents can even install their own skills at runtime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Desktop-grade">
    Built with Tauri v2 for native performance. Rust backend, vanilla TypeScript frontend, SQLite storage. 530 automated tests. Zero known CVEs. Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
