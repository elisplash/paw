# Create Your First Agent

Agents are the core of Pawz. Each agent has its own personality, AI model, tools, and conversation history.

## Create an agent

1. Click **Agents** in the sidebar
2. Click the **Create Agent** card
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** — give it a recognizable name (e.g., "Research Bot", "Code Helper")
   - **Bio** — a short description of what this agent does
4. Click **Create**

That's it — your agent is ready to chat.

## Customize your agent

Click the **Edit** button on any agent card to configure:

### Personality
| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Tone** | Casual / Balanced / Formal | How the agent communicates |
| **Initiative** | Reactive / Balanced / Proactive | How much the agent takes action on its own |
| **Detail** | Brief / Balanced / Thorough | How detailed responses are |

### Model
Each agent can use a different AI model. Click the model dropdown to pick from your configured providers. Use `default` to inherit the global model setting.

### System prompt
Add custom instructions in the system prompt field. This is injected into every conversation with this agent.

### Soul files
When you create an agent, Pawz automatically generates three files:
- **IDENTITY.md** — name, role, specialty, personality
- **SOUL.md** — values and communication style (edit to customize deeply)
- **USER.md** — learned preferences about you (grows over time)

## Chat with your agent

Click on any agent card to open the main chat view with that agent selected. Or click the agent's avatar in the **Agent Dock** (bottom-right corner) to open a mini-chat popup.

### Mini-chat popups
Each agent gets its own floating chat window — like Facebook Messenger. You can have multiple open at once, each talking to a different agent.

### Agent dock
The dock at the bottom-right shows all your agents as avatar circles. Hover to see the agent's name. Click the toggle button to collapse/expand the dock.

## What's next?

- [Connect an AI provider](/first-provider) so your agent has a model to use
- [Learn about skills](/guides/skills) to give your agent more capabilities
- [Set up channels](/channels/overview) so your agent can respond on Telegram, Discord, etc.
