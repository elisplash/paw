OpenPawz isn't just a chat app — it's an **agent operating system**. Here's what people build with it.

## Use cases

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Personal AI assistant" icon="user" href="/start/first-agent">
    Run an agent on Telegram or WhatsApp that knows your preferences, remembers past conversations, and executes tasks — email, calendar, web browsing, smart home control. Speaks responses aloud via TTS and listens via speech-to-text.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-platform support bot" icon="headset" href="/channels/overview">
    Connect a single agent to Discord, Slack, and Matrix simultaneously. Same personality, same memory, different platforms. Smart message splitting handles each platform's limits automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Autonomous trading desk" icon="chart-line" href="/guides/trading">
    Agents trade crypto across three chains — Coinbase, Solana (Jupiter/Pump.fun), Ethereum (Uniswap). Policy guardrails keep everything within bounds while you sleep. Full audit trail.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Research squad" icon="magnifying-glass" href="/guides/orchestrator">
    A coordinator delegates to specialist agents — web researcher, data analyst, writer. Workers run in parallel with headless Chrome. Squads persist and reuse across projects.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DevOps automation" icon="gears" href="/guides/automations">
    Cron tasks, event triggers, sandboxed shell commands. Wire up triggers → agents → tools → outputs in the visual node editor. Pipe results to GitHub Actions, Zapier, or any HTTP client.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content pipeline" icon="pen-nib" href="/guides/content-studio">
    Draft documents with AI assistance. Route different content types to specialized agents — blog posts, social media, technical docs. Agents research, write, and publish through connected channels.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Voice assistant" icon="microphone" href="/guides/voice">
    Three TTS providers (Google, OpenAI, ElevenLabs) with configurable voice, speed, and language. Auto-speak mode reads all responses aloud. Combine with Telegram or Webchat for full voice-driven UX.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-improving network" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/guides/skills">
    Agents discover and install capabilities at runtime. An agent encounters a new task, searches PawzHub, installs a skill, and immediately uses it — all conversationally. No restarts.
  </Card>
