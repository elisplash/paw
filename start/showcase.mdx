## What you can build

OpenPawz isn't just a chat app — it's an agent operating system. Here's what people build with it.

---

### Personal AI assistant

Run an agent on Telegram or WhatsApp that knows your preferences, remembers past conversations, and can execute tasks — send emails, check weather, manage your calendar, browse the web. It speaks responses aloud via TTS and listens via speech-to-text.

  Create your first agent in under 5 minutes.

### Multi-platform support bot

Connect a single agent to Discord, Slack, and Matrix simultaneously. Same personality, same memory, different platforms. Replies go back to the channel they came from. Smart message splitting handles each platform's limits automatically.

<Card title="Connect channels" href="/channels/overview">
  Set up multi-channel routing.
</Card>

---

### Autonomous trading desk

Agents trade crypto autonomously across **three chains** — Coinbase exchange, Solana (Jupiter/Pump.fun), and Ethereum (Uniswap). Set policy guardrails: max trade size, daily loss limits, allowed pairs. The trading policy engine ensures agents stay within bounds while you sleep. Full audit trail for every trade.

  Set up multi-chain DeFi trading.

### Research squad

Create a squad of specialist agents — a coordinator, a web researcher, a data analyst, and a writer. The coordinator delegates, workers run in parallel with headless Chrome, and the squad produces a synthesis. Agent squads persist and can be reused across projects.

### DevOps & automation pipeline

Schedule cron tasks, trigger agents on events, run shell commands in sandboxed containers. Use the visual node editor to wire up triggers → agents → tools → outputs without writing code. Pipe results through webhooks to GitHub Actions, Zapier, or any HTTP client.

  Cron jobs, triggers, and scheduled agent tasks.

### Content creation pipeline

Use the Content Studio to draft documents with AI assistance. Agents research, write, and publish through connected channels. Route different content types to specialized agents — one for blog posts, another for social media, a third for technical docs.

  Built-in editor with AI writing assistance.

### Voice assistant

Turn any agent into a voice assistant. Three TTS providers (Google, OpenAI, ElevenLabs) with configurable voice, speed, and language. Auto-speak mode reads all responses aloud. Combine with Telegram or Webchat for a full voice-driven experience.

<Card title="Voice guide" href="/guides/voice">
  Text-to-speech and speech-to-text setup.
</Card>

---

### Self-improving agent network

Agents that discover and install their own capabilities. An agent encounters a new task type, searches PawzHub for a relevant skill, installs it, and immediately uses it — all conversationally, at runtime. No restarts, no manual configuration.
