## What you can build

OpenPawz isn't just a chat app — it's an agent platform. Here's what people use it for.

---

### Personal AI assistant

Run an agent on Telegram or WhatsApp that knows your preferences, remembers past conversations, and can execute tasks — send emails, check weather, manage your calendar, browse the web.

### Multi-platform support bot

Connect a single agent to Discord, Slack, and Matrix simultaneously. Same personality, same memory, different platforms. Replies go back to the channel they came from.

### Research assistant

Use the browser sandbox to have agents crawl, extract, and summarize web content. Combine with the orchestrator to run parallel research tasks across multiple agents.
