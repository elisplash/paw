## Platform features

OpenPawz ships with everything you need to run autonomous AI agents locally. No plugins required for the basics — install, configure, and go.

## Agents

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Custom personalities">
    Each agent has a name, bio, system prompt, and personality. Agents can be formal assistants, creative writers, code reviewers — whatever you need.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tool use">
    Agents call tools autonomously — send emails, search the web, execute shell commands, interact with APIs. 75+ tools built in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory">
    Semantic long-term memory with auto-capture and auto-recall. Agents remember facts, preferences, and context across sessions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Session management">
    Automatic session compaction keeps context windows efficient. Old sessions archive, new ones start with memory context.
  </Card>
</Columns>

| Telegram | Bot API | Stable |
| Discord | Bot | Stable |
| Slack | Bot | Stable |
| Matrix | Client | Stable |
| IRC | Client | Stable |
| WhatsApp | Web bridge | Stable |
| Twitch | Chat | Stable |
| Mattermost | Bot | Stable |
| Nextcloud Talk | Bot | Stable |
| Nostr | Relay | Stable |
| Webchat | Built-in | Stable |

| Provider | Type | Models |
|---|---|---|
| Ollama | Local | Llama, Mistral, Gemma, etc. |
| OpenAI | Cloud | GPT-4o, o1, o3 |
| Anthropic | Cloud | Claude 4, Sonnet |
| Google | Cloud | Gemini 2.x |
| DeepSeek | Cloud | DeepSeek V3, R1 |
| Grok | Cloud | Grok 3 |
| Mistral | Cloud | Mistral Large, Codestral |
| OpenRouter | Cloud | Multi-model gateway |
| Moonshot | Cloud | Kimi |
| Custom | Any | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Skills">
    **Prompt-only extensibility.** Drop a `SKILL.md` file to inject expert knowledge into any agent's system prompt. No code, no API — just markdown.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Integrations">
    **Custom tools + commands.** Add custom tools with slash commands and dedicated UI panels. Full Tauri API access.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Extensions">
    **Full sidebar apps.** Build complete sidebar views with persistent storage. The most powerful extensibility tier.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MCP">

## Orchestration & workflows

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multi-agent projects">
    Boss agent delegates tasks to specialist workers. Parallel execution with result aggregation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Task management">
    Kanban board with cron scheduling, event triggers, and automatic agent assignment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automations">
    Time-based and event-driven triggers that run agent actions without manual input.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Research flows">
    Multi-step web research with browser sandbox, extraction, and summarization pipelines.
  </Card>

## Memory & intelligence

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Semantic long-term memory">
    Agents auto-capture facts, preferences, and context from every conversation. Vector embeddings power instant recall — relevant memories are injected before the agent responds. Your agents build knowledge over weeks and months.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Palace">
    A dedicated interface to browse, search, edit, and delete stored memories. Full transparency into what your AI knows. Filter by agent, topic, date, or relevance score.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Session compaction">
    When conversations approach context limits, OpenPawz automatically summarizes older messages, preserves key facts in memory, and continues seamlessly. Agents run indefinitely without losing context — and you save 40–60% on tokens.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared & isolated memory">
    By default, all agents share a memory namespace — knowledge captured by one is available to all. Isolate per agent or per workspace when you need boundaries.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Security

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="100% local — zero cloud">
    All data stays on your hardware. No cloud sync, no telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home. The only network traffic is to AI providers you explicitly configure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="OS keychain credentials">
    API keys and secrets stored in macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service. Never in plain text. Never in a config file.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Command risk classification">
    Every tool and shell command rated 1–5 for risk. High-risk operations require explicit user confirmation. Configurable thresholds per agent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Container sandbox">
    Isolate agent shell access in Docker containers with configurable CPU, memory, network, and filesystem restrictions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per-agent policies">
    Granular control over what each agent can access — tools, channels, risk levels, and actions. Lock down sensitive agents or give trusted ones free rein.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prompt injection defense">
    Built-in detection analyzes incoming messages for manipulation attempts and flags suspicious content before it reaches your agents.
  </Card>
</Columns>
