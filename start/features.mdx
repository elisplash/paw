## Agents

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Custom personalities">
    Each agent has a name, bio, system prompt, emoji, and avatar. Three personality axes — **tone** (casual → formal), **initiative** (reactive → proactive), and **detail** (brief → thorough) — let you fine-tune behavior without prompt engineering.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent templates">
    Pre-built archetypes — General, Research, Creative, Technical, Custom — so you're productive in seconds. Templates set personality, system prompt, and tool access automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="25,000+ integrations">
    400+ native integrations compiled into the binary, plus 25,000+ community integrations via the MCP Bridge to n8n. Agents discover and auto-deploy workflows at runtime, on demand.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Soul files">
    Persistent identity documents for each agent. Soul files store personality notes, custom instructions, and identity data that persist across sessions. Your agent evolves over time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per-agent workspaces">
    Every agent gets an isolated filesystem workspace with file listing, browsing, and cleanup. Agents can't accidentally interfere with each other's files.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent boundaries">
    Define what each agent should and shouldn't do. Boundary rules constrain behavior without complex prompt engineering — just plain language rules.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per-agent model override">
    Each agent can use a different AI model, overriding the global default. Run your research agent on Claude, your coder on GPT-4o, and your assistant on a local Ollama model — simultaneously.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auto-approve mode">
    Trusted agents can skip human-in-the-loop approval prompts entirely. Toggle per agent — full autonomy for agents you trust, strict oversight for new ones.
  </Card>

  </Card>
  <Card title="Per-channel agent routing">
    Assign a specific agent to each channel. Your support bot handles Discord, your research agent handles Slack, your personal assistant handles Telegram — all from one app.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Channel routing rules">
    Rule-based routing engine with first-match logic. Route messages to specific agents based on channel, user, keywords, or custom conditions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart message splitting">
    Long responses automatically split at platform-appropriate boundaries. Discord's 2000-char limit, Telegram's 4096-char limit — handled transparently.

## Extensibility — three tiers + marketplace

OpenPawz has the most sophisticated extension system of any agent platform. **Three tiers** let you start simple and graduate to full apps — plus a community marketplace.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Skills (Tier 1)">
    **Drop a markdown file.** That's it. A `SKILL.md` file injects expert knowledge into an agent's system prompt. No code, no config, no API — just markdown. Hot-reloaded from `~/.paw/skills/` with no restart needed.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Integrations (Tier 2)">
    **Custom tools + commands.** A `pawz-skill.toml` manifest adds credentials, binary detection, agent tools, and dashboard widgets. Full Tauri API access.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Extensions (Tier 3)">
    **Full sidebar applications.** Build complete sidebar views with persistent key-value storage, custom UI panels, and dashboard widgets. The most powerful tier.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MCP">
    **Model Context Protocol.** Connect to any MCP server — stdio or Streamable HTTP transport — for unlimited external tools. Databases, APIs, file systems, and more.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="PawzHub marketplace">
    **Discover and share.** Browse community-built skills, integrations, and extensions. Search by keyword, filter by tier. Visual badge system: Blue (Skill), Purple (Integration), Gold (Extension), plus Verified, Official, and Popular tags.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Agent-installable skills">

## Memory — the most advanced retrieval system in any agent platform

Most AI tools forget everything between conversations. OpenPawz has the most sophisticated memory system available — **four retrieval strategies combined**.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hybrid retrieval">
    **No other platform does this.** BM25 full-text search + vector similarity (cosine) combined with weighted merging. You get the precision of keyword search and the flexibility of semantic search — together.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MMR re-ranking">
    Maximal Marginal Relevance with Jaccard-based diversity ensures recalled memories are both relevant AND diverse. No more getting five copies of the same memory.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Temporal decay">
    Exponential decay with a 30-day half-life. Recent memories rank higher than old ones. Your agent prioritizes what's current without losing long-term knowledge.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auto-capture & auto-recall">
    Key facts are automatically extracted from every conversation and stored with vector embeddings. When context is relevant, memories are injected before the agent responds — zero manual effort.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Memory Palace">
    A dedicated interface to browse, search, edit, and delete memories. Filter by agent, topic, date, category, or relevance score. Full transparency into what your AI knows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Importance scoring">
    Each memory receives an importance score (0–1). Critical facts rank higher than casual observations. The system learns what matters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory backfill">
    Retroactively generate vector embeddings for existing memories. Upgrade your memory system without starting over.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared & isolated namespaces">
    All agents share memory by default — knowledge captured by one is available to all. Isolate per agent or per workspace when you need boundaries.
  </Card>
</Columns>

→ Deep dive: [Memory guide](/guides/memory)

## Session management & token savings

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automatic session compaction">
    When conversations approach the context limit, OpenPawz summarizes older messages, preserves key facts in memory, archives the full session, and continues seamlessly. Agents run **indefinitely long conversations** — and you pay for 40–60% fewer tokens.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Thinking level control">
    **Unique to OpenPawz.** Adjust reasoning depth per session — none, low, medium, high. Need a quick answer? Use low. Complex analysis? Crank it up. You control the compute.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configurable context windows">
    Set the context window size in tokens (default 32,000). Larger windows for complex tasks, smaller ones for cost savings. Per-session control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Max concurrent runs">
    Limit simultaneous agent runs across chat, cron, and tasks. Chat always gets priority. Prevent runaway costs from parallel automations.
