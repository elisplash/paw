## Agents

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Custom personalities">
    Each agent has a name, bio, system prompt, and personality. Agents can be formal assistants, creative writers, code reviewers — whatever you need.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tool use">
    Agents call tools autonomously — send emails, search the web, execute shell commands, interact with APIs. 75+ tools built in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory">
    Semantic long-term memory with auto-capture and auto-recall. Agents remember facts, preferences, and context across sessions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Session management">
    Automatic session compaction keeps context windows efficient. Old sessions archive, new ones start with memory context.
  </Card>
