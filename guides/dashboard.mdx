# Dashboard & Today

The Dashboard (also called the Today view) is your landing page in Pawz. It provides an at-a-glance overview of your day with a weather widget, task list, quick action buttons, and a personalized greeting from your active agent.

## Greeting

The dashboard displays a time-based greeting that changes throughout the day:

| Time | Greeting |
|------|----------|
| Before 12:00 PM | Good morning |
| 12:00 PM – 5:59 PM | Good afternoon |
| 6:00 PM onwards | Good evening |

The greeting is accompanied by your active agent's avatar.

## Weather widget

The dashboard includes a weather widget powered by [wttr.in](https://wttr.in).

- **No API key required** — wttr.in is a free, open service
- Displays current conditions for your location
- Updates automatically when the dashboard loads

:::tip
The wttr.in service uses your IP address for geolocation. If you're using a VPN, the weather will reflect the VPN server's location.

## Task list

A lightweight task manager is built directly into the dashboard for quick daily planning.

### Operations

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create** | Add a new task with a title |
| **Toggle** | Mark a task as complete/incomplete |
| **Edit** | Update a task's title |
| **Delete** | Remove a task from the list |

Tasks on the dashboard are stored in **localStorage** and are separate from the full Kanban task board (which uses the engine's SQLite database). Think of these as quick personal reminders rather than agent-managed tasks.

:::info
For full-featured task management with agent assignment, cron scheduling, and Kanban workflows, use the **Tasks** view instead.

## Quick action buttons

The dashboard provides one-click quick actions that send pre-built prompts to your active agent:

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Morning Briefing** | Asks the agent to prepare a morning summary with weather, calendar, tasks, and news |
| **Summarize Inbox** | Asks the agent to summarize recent emails and messages |
| **What's on today?** | Asks the agent to outline your agenda for the day |

These actions open the chat view and send the corresponding prompt immediately, so your agent can start working right away.

## Agent avatar display

Your currently active agent's avatar is displayed prominently on the dashboard. Pawz uses a sprite-based avatar system with 50 unique avatars, each assigned a color from a 7-color palette.

:::tip
Customize your agent's avatar and color in the **Agents** view to make the dashboard feel personal.

## Skill output widgets

Community integrations and extensions can display live data on the dashboard using **skill output widgets**. When an agent uses the `skill_output` tool, the data is persisted in SQL and rendered as a widget card on the Today page.

### How it works

1. A community skill defines a `[widget]` section in its `pawz-skill.toml` manifest
2. The agent calls `skill_output` with structured JSON data (e.g., a table of CRM deals, stock prices, or system metrics)
3. The data is stored in the `skill_outputs` table
4. The dashboard renders the widget with the declared field definitions — supporting text, number, currency, badge, and date column types

### Widget types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `table` | Tabular data with sortable columns |
| `stat` | Single metric with label and value |
| `list` | Ordered or unordered item list |

### Refresh

Widgets can declare a refresh interval (e.g., `refresh = "5m"`) to automatically re-render with the latest data. The agent's cron task can be configured to periodically update the skill output.

:::tip
Combine skill output widgets with **event-driven triggers** to update dashboard data in real-time when webhooks arrive or agents communicate.
