# Tasks

The Tasks view is a kanban board for managing work items that agents can pick up and execute.

## Board columns

| Column | Status | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Inbox** | `inbox` | New tasks, unassigned |
| **Assigned** | `assigned` | Agent assigned, not started |
| **In Progress** | `in_progress` | Agent actively working |
| **Review** | `review` | Completed, needs human review |
| **Blocked** | `blocked` | Waiting on something |
| **Done** | `done` | Finished |

Drag and drop tasks between columns to change status.

## Creating a task

1. Click **New Task**
2. Fill in:
   - **Title** — what needs to be done
   - **Description** — details and context
   - **Priority** — low / medium / high / urgent
   - **Assigned agent** — which agent handles it
   - **Model override** — use a specific model for this task

## Priority levels

| Priority | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| `low` | Nice to have, no deadline |
| `medium` | Standard priority |
| `high` | Important, do soon |
| `urgent` | Do immediately |

## Multi-agent assignment

Tasks can have multiple agents:

- **Lead** — primary agent responsible for the task
- **Collaborator** — assists the lead agent

## Scheduling with cron

Tasks can run on a schedule:

1. Open a task
2. Set a **cron schedule** (standard cron syntax)
3. Enable **cron**

The engine checks for due tasks every 60 seconds.

### Cron examples

```
0 9 * * *       Every day at 9 AM
0 */2 * * *     Every 2 hours
0 9 * * 1-5     Weekdays at 9 AM
*/30 * * * *    Every 30 minutes
```

## Activity feed

Each task has a live activity feed showing:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `created` | Task was created |
| `assigned` | Agent was assigned |
| `status_change` | Task moved to a new column |
| `comment` | Human added a note |
| `agent_started` | Agent began working |
| `agent_completed` | Agent finished |
| `agent_error` | Agent encountered an error |
| `cron_triggered` | Scheduled run fired |

Filter the feed by: **All**, **Tasks only**, or **Status changes**.

## Task statuses

Each task has a **board status** (which column it sits in) and an underlying **execution status** that tracks the agent's progress:

| Board column | Execution status | Description |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Inbox** | `pending` | Not yet picked up by any agent |
| **Assigned** | `pending` | Agent assigned but hasn't started |
| **In Progress** | `in_progress` | Agent is actively executing |
| **Review** | `completed` | Agent finished — awaiting human review |
| **Blocked** | `failed` / `cancelled` | Something went wrong or was stopped |
| **Done** | `completed` | Fully finished and approved |

:::info
When an agent encounters an error, the task moves to **Blocked** with a `failed` execution status. You can reassign it or move it back to **Inbox** to retry.
:::

### Cancelling a task

To cancel a running task:

1. Open the task
2. Drag it to **Blocked** or click **Delete**
3. The agent's session is aborted and the execution status becomes `cancelled`

## Task templates

Create reusable task templates by combining cron scheduling with pre-filled fields:

1. Create a task with a descriptive **title** and **description**
2. Assign an agent and set the **priority**
3. Set a **cron schedule** (e.g. `0 9 * * 1-5` for weekday mornings)
4. Enable **cron** — the task will recreate itself on schedule

### Common template patterns

| Template | Cron | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Daily standup | `0 9 * * 1-5` | Summarize yesterday's activity |
| Hourly monitoring | `0 * * * *` | Check services and report issues |
| Weekly report | `0 17 * * 5` | Generate end-of-week summary |
| PR review | `*/30 * * * *` | Check for new pull requests |
| News digest | `0 8 * * *` | Research and summarize news |

:::tip
Combine templates with **model overrides** to use cheaper models for routine checks and powerful models for complex analysis tasks.
