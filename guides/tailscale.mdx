# Tailscale

Tailscale integration lets you access Pawz remotely and expose agent services over your tailnet.

## What is Tailscale?

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) creates a private mesh VPN between your devices. With Pawz + Tailscale, you can:

- Access Pawz from any device on your tailnet
- Expose agent services (webhooks, APIs) to your other machines
- Use Tailscale Funnel to make services available on the public internet

## Setup

1. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download)
2. Authenticate: `tailscale up`
3. Enable in Pawz **Settings → Advanced**

## Tailscale Serve

Expose a local service to your tailnet:

```bash
# Expose Pawz webchat on your tailnet
tailscale serve https / http://localhost:3000
```

Other devices on your tailnet can now access Pawz at `https://your-machine.tail-net.ts.net/`.

## Tailscale Funnel

Expose a service to the public internet:

```bash
# Make webchat publicly accessible
tailscale funnel 443 http://localhost:3000
```

:::warning
Funnel makes your service accessible to anyone on the internet. Only use this if you want public access.

## Use cases

- **Remote access** — use Pawz from your phone or another computer
- **Webhook receiver** — let external services (GitHub, Stripe) send events to your agents
- **Webchat** — run a public-facing chatbot powered by your Pawz agents
- **API gateway** — expose agent APIs for other apps to consume
