# n8n

Connect your Pawz agents to [n8n](https://n8n.io) — the open-source workflow automation platform. Your agents can list, trigger, activate, and monitor n8n workflows using the n8n REST API.

<Note>
This is a **Tier 2 Integration** — it uses encrypted credentials and `fetch`-based API calls. No additional binaries required.
</Note>

## Why n8n + OpenPawz?

n8n is a visual workflow automation tool (like Zapier, but self-hosted and open-source). Combining it with OpenPawz gives you:

- **Natural language workflow control** — tell your agent "run the weekly report workflow" instead of clicking through the n8n UI
- **Bidirectional automation** — n8n triggers agents via webhooks, agents trigger n8n via the API
- **Monitoring** — agents check execution history and report failures
- **Dynamic orchestration** — agents activate/deactivate workflows based on context (e.g. "pause all marketing workflows until Monday")

```mermaid actions={false}
graph LR
    subgraph OpenPawz
        A["Agent"] -->|"fetch → n8n API"| B["n8n Integration"]
    end
    subgraph n8n
        B -->|"List / Execute / Monitor"| C["Workflows"]
        C -->|"Webhook trigger"| A
    end
```

## Setup

### 1. Get your n8n API key

1. Open your n8n instance (e.g. `http://localhost:5678`)
2. Go to **Settings → API**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy the key

### 2. Install the integration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="From PawzHub">
    1. Open the **Skills** tab in the sidebar
    2. Search for **n8n**
    3. Click **Install**
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual">
    Place the manifest at:
    ```
    ~/.paw/skills/n8n/pawz-skill.toml
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Configure credentials

1. Go to **Settings → Skills**
2. Find the **n8n** integration
3. Enter:
   - **n8n API Key** — the key from step 1
   - **n8n Instance URL** — your n8n base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:5678`, no trailing slash)

### 4. Assign to an agent

1. Open the **Agents** tab
2. Select the agent you want to connect
3. Go to the agent's **Skills** sub-tab
4. Enable **n8n**

## What your agent can do

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **List workflows** | See all workflows with their active/inactive status |
| **Execute a workflow** | Trigger any workflow by name or ID, optionally passing input data |
| **Trigger via webhook** | Hit a workflow's webhook URL with a JSON payload |
| **Activate / Deactivate** | Turn workflows on or off |
| **Check executions** | View recent execution history, success/failure status |
| **Debug failures** | Fetch execution details to see which node failed and why |

---

## Example prompts

Once the integration is enabled, just talk to your agent:

> "List all my n8n workflows"

> "Run the 'Daily Report' workflow"

> "Check if the last run of 'Email Digest' succeeded"

> "Deactivate all workflows with 'test' in the name"

> "Trigger the onboarding webhook with this data: {name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com'}"

---

## Bidirectional: n8n triggering agents

n8n can also trigger your Pawz agents using OpenPawz's built-in webhook server:

1. **Enable the webhook server** in OpenPawz (Settings → Webhook)
2. In n8n, add an **HTTP Request** node pointing to your Pawz webhook endpoint
3. Send a JSON payload with the message and target agent

This creates a full loop: agents trigger n8n workflows, and n8n workflows trigger agents.

```mermaid actions={false}
graph TD
    A["User asks agent:\n'Run the daily report'"] --> B["Agent calls n8n API\nPOST /workflows/123/run"]
    B --> C["n8n executes workflow\nCollects data, sends emails"]
    C --> D["n8n hits Pawz webhook\n'Report complete: 42 records'"]
    D --> E["Agent tells user:\n'Daily report done — 42 records processed'"]
```

---

## Dashboard widget

The integration includes a **Workflows** widget on the Dashboard showing:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Workflow** | Workflow name |
| **Status** | Active (green) or Inactive (gray) |
| **Last Updated** | When the workflow was last modified |

The widget refreshes every 5 minutes.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Verify your API key in Skills settings. Regenerate if expired. |
| Connection refused | Check that your n8n instance is running and the URL is correct. |
| Workflow not found | Ask the agent to list all workflows first to confirm available IDs. |
| Execution fails | Ask the agent to fetch execution details — it will show which node errored. |
| Webhook not working | Ensure the n8n workflow is **active** and the webhook path matches. |

## Security notes

- Your n8n API key is **encrypted** in the Pawz vault (XOR, 32-byte key in OS keychain) — never stored in plain text
- In RAM, the API key is wrapped in `Zeroizing<String>` — automatically zeroed from memory when the provider is dropped
- API calls go directly from your machine to your n8n instance — no cloud relay
- All outbound requests use the **certificate-pinned TLS client** (Mozilla root CAs only, OS trust store excluded)
- Every outbound request is **SHA-256 signed** and logged to the audit ring buffer for tamper detection
- The `fetch` domain allowlist applies — make sure your n8n domain is allowed if you have a blocklist configured
