# Session Management

Sessions are the core unit of conversation in Pawz. Each session holds a complete chat history between you and an agent, with built-in tools for renaming, clearing, compacting, and deleting conversations.

## Session data model

Every session is stored in the engine's SQLite database with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique session identifier |
| `label` | String | User-friendly display name |
| `model` | String | AI model used in this session |
| `system_prompt` | String | Custom system prompt (if any) |
| `agent_id` | String | The agent assigned to this session |
| `message_count` | Number | Total messages in the session |
| `created_at` | Timestamp | When the session was created |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp | Last activity time |

## Session operations

### List

Retrieve all sessions, optionally filtered by agent. Sessions are displayed as cards in **Settings → Sessions** showing the label, model badge, message count, and timestamps.

### Rename

Update the session label to something more meaningful. Use the slash command:

```
/rename My research on quantum computing
```

Or click the rename action on the session card in Settings.

### Clear

Remove **all messages** from a session while keeping the session itself. This is useful when you want a fresh start without losing your session configuration.

:::warning
Clearing a session is destructive — all messages are permanently removed. Pawz requires a double-confirm before proceeding.
:::

### Delete

Permanently remove a session and all its messages from the database.

:::warning
Deletion is irreversible. A double-confirm dialog will appear before the session is removed.
:::

### Compact

Compress the session's message history using AI-generated summaries. See [Session Compaction](#session-compaction) below.

## Session compaction

Long conversations consume large context windows, which increases cost and can hit model token limits. Session compaction solves this by replacing older messages with a concise AI-generated summary.

### How it works

```
Messages pile up in session
        ↓
Auto-trigger check before each turn
        ↓
≥20 messages AND >60,000 estimated tokens?
        ↓  YES
AI generates summary of older messages
        ↓
Older messages replaced with single summary message
        ↓
Recent messages preserved intact
```

### Compaction configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `min_messages` | 20 | Minimum message count before compaction triggers |
| `token_threshold` | 60,000 | Estimated token count threshold |
| `keep_recent` | 6 | Number of recent messages to preserve unchanged |
| `max_summary_tokens` | 2,000 | Maximum tokens for the generated summary |

### Token estimation

Pawz estimates token counts using a simple heuristic: **~4 characters per token**. This is intentionally conservative to avoid exceeding model context limits.

### Auto-trigger

Before each new conversation turn, the engine checks:

1. Does this session have **≥20 messages**?
2. Is the estimated token count **>60,000 tokens**?

If both conditions are met, compaction runs automatically before the new message is processed.

### Manual trigger

You can force compaction at any time using the slash command:

```
/compact
```

This is useful when you want to reclaim context space mid-conversation without waiting for the auto-trigger threshold.

:::tip
Use `/compact` proactively before starting a complex task in a long session. This gives the agent maximum context space to work with.

## Session Settings UI

Navigate to **Settings → Sessions** to manage all your sessions in one place:

- **Session cards** show the label, model badge, message count, and timestamps
- **Expandable actions** per card: Rename, Clear, Delete
- **Double-confirm pattern** for all destructive operations (Clear and Delete)

## Slash commands for sessions

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new [label]` | Start a new session (optional label) |
| `/rename <label>` | Rename the current session |
| `/clear` | Clear all messages in the current session |
| `/compact` | Manually trigger session compaction |

:::info
Session data is stored in the engine-side SQLite database, separate from frontend state. This means sessions persist across app restarts and are tied to the backend engine.
