# Projects — File Browser

The Projects view is a local file browser built into Pawz. It lets you browse project folders, inspect Git status, and preview text files — all within the app using Tauri's filesystem APIs.

## Adding projects

1. Open the **Projects** view
2. Click **Add Folder**
3. Select a local directory
4. The folder appears in your project list with its directory tree

### Operations

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Add folder** | Browse and add a local directory to your project list |
| **Remove folder** | Remove a project from the list (does not delete files on disk) |
| **Refresh** | Re-read the directory tree and update Git status |

Projects are persisted in **localStorage**, so your project list survives app restarts.

## File tree

Each project displays an expandable directory tree:

- **Lazy loading**: Subdirectories are only read when you expand them, keeping the UI responsive for large projects
- **File icons**: Files and folders are visually distinguished
- **Click to preview**: Clicking a text file opens a read-only preview

### File preview

The file viewer provides a **read-only** text preview of file contents. This is useful for quick inspection without leaving Pawz.

:::info
File preview is read-only by design. To edit files, use the agent's `write_file` or `edit_file` tools, or open the file in your preferred editor.
:::

## Git integration

For projects that are Git repositories, Pawz displays rich status information:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Branch** | Current checked-out branch |
| **Remote** | Configured remote URL |
| **Dirty files** | Number of uncommitted changes |
| **Ahead/Behind** | Commits ahead of or behind the remote |
| **Last commit** | Most recent commit message and hash |

Git information is fetched via `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell` and can be refreshed manually with the **Refresh** button.

:::tip
Use the refresh button after committing or pulling to see updated Git status without restarting the app.

## Security

The Projects view enforces strict security boundaries to prevent browsing sensitive system paths.

### Blocked paths

The following **18 sensitive path patterns** are blocked from browsing:

| Pattern | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `.ssh` | SSH keys and configuration |
| `.gnupg` | GPG keys and keyrings |
| `.aws` | AWS credentials and config |
| `.kube` | Kubernetes configuration |
| `.docker` | Docker credentials |
| `.gnome-keyring` | GNOME keyring directory |
| `.password-store` | Password store directory |
| `.netrc` | Network authentication credentials |
| `/etc` | System configuration |
| `/root` | Root user home |
| `/var/log` | System logs |
| `/proc` | Process information pseudo-filesystem |
| `/sys` | Kernel/device pseudo-filesystem |
| `/dev` | Device filesystem |
| `C:\Windows` | Windows system directory |
| `C:\Users\*\AppData` | AppData directory |
| `.openclaw` | OpenClaw config (contains tokens) |
| `.config/himalaya` | Himalaya email config |

### Security event logging

Any attempt to access a blocked path is logged via `logSecurityEvent()` with the following details:

- **Tool name**: The operation attempted
- **Command**: The path that was blocked
- **Risk level**: Security classification
- **Detail**: Human-readable explanation
- **Was allowed**: Always `false` for blocked paths

:::warning
These security restrictions cannot be bypassed from the UI. They are enforced at the application level to protect sensitive system data from accidental exposure to AI agents.
