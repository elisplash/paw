# Research

The Research view lets agents conduct structured web research with source tracking and credibility scoring.

## Modes

| Mode | Sources | Timeout | When to use |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Quick** | 3–5 | 120s | Fast answers, simple questions |
| **Deep** | 10+ | 300s | Thorough investigation, complex topics |

## Workflow

1. Enter a research query
2. Choose **Quick** or **Deep** mode
3. Watch the live progress:
   - **Searching** — finding sources
   - **Reading** — fetching pages
   - **Analyzing** — processing content
   - **Found** — result discovered
   - **Summarizing** — generating synthesis
4. Review findings with sources

## Findings

Each research finding includes:

- **Summary** — key takeaway
- **Content** — full extracted text
- **Key points** — bullet-point highlights
- **Sources** — URLs with titles and credibility scores (1–5)

### Source credibility

Sources are scored on a 1–5 scale shown as dots:
- ●●●●● — Highly credible (academic, official docs)
- ●●●●○ — Generally reliable
- ●●●○○ — Mixed reliability
- ●●○○○ — Use with caution
- ●○○○○ — Unreliable

## Actions

For each finding you can:
- **Dig Deeper** — ask follow-up questions about this finding
- **Find Related** — search for related topics
- **View Full** — see the complete content
- **Delete** — remove the finding

## Reports

Generate a compiled report from your findings:
- Saved as markdown to `~/Documents/Paw/Research/`
- Includes all findings, sources, and key points
- Per-project sessions with query history

## Deep research mode

Deep mode performs multi-step web research with synthesis:

1. **Query expansion** — the agent breaks your topic into multiple sub-queries
2. **Parallel search** — searches DuckDuckGo for each sub-query (10+ sources)
3. **Source fetching** — reads full page content from each result URL
4. **Cross-referencing** — compares claims across multiple sources
5. **Synthesis** — generates a comprehensive finding with key points and credibility scores

| Setting | Quick mode | Deep mode |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Sources fetched | 3–5 | 10+ |
| Timeout | 120 seconds | 300 seconds |
| Sub-queries | 1 | Multiple (auto-generated) |
| Cross-referencing | No | Yes |
| Best for | Simple factual questions | Complex topics, comparisons, analysis |

:::tip
Deep research uses more tokens and takes longer. Start with Quick mode to validate your query, then switch to Deep for thorough investigation.

## Research notebook integration

All research data is saved to your local workspace at `~/Documents/Paw/Research/`:

```
~/Documents/Paw/Research/
├── <project-id>/
│   ├── project.json        # Project metadata and query history
│   ├── README.md            # Human-readable project summary
│   ├── findings/
│   │   ├── <finding-id>.json  # Structured finding with sources
│   │   └── ...
│   └── reports/
│       ├── <report-id>.json   # Generated research reports
│       └── ...
```

Each project maintains:
- **Query history** — every research query you've run
- **Findings** — structured results with content, summaries, key points, and sources
- **Reports** — compiled multi-finding reports

Use the **folder icon** in the project header to open the research folder in your file manager.

## Citation and source tracking

Every research finding tracks its sources with full provenance:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `url` | Original source URL |
| `title` | Page title or domain name |
| `credibility` | 1–5 score (see [Source credibility](#source-credibility)) |
| `extractedAt` | Timestamp when the source was fetched |
| `snippets` | Relevant text excerpts from the source |

The **Sources panel** (right sidebar) aggregates all sources across findings in the current project, making it easy to review which sites were consulted.

### Live source feed

During active research, a live feed shows sources as they're discovered in real-time. Each source displays its domain and credibility score as the agent processes it.

## Research export formats

Research can be exported in several ways:

| Format | How | Contents |
|--------|-----|----------|
| **Markdown report** | Click **Generate Report** | Executive summary, key findings, analysis, conclusions, bibliography |
| **Individual findings** | Click **Full** on any finding | Complete content with sources and key points |
| **Raw JSON** | Open `~/Documents/Paw/Research/` | Machine-readable findings with all metadata |
| **Project folder** | Click **Open in Finder** | All findings, reports, and project config |

### Generating a report

1. Conduct several research queries to build up findings
2. Click **Generate Report**
3. The agent synthesizes all findings into a structured report:
   - Executive Summary
   - Key Findings (organized by theme)
   - Detailed Analysis
   - Conclusions and Recommendations
   - Sources Bibliography
4. The report is saved as markdown in the project's `reports/` folder

## Tips

- Start with a broad quick search, then dig deeper on interesting findings
- Use the source credibility scores to prioritize reliable information
- Chain findings together: dig deeper → find related → synthesize
