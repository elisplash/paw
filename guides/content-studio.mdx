# Content Studio

The Content Studio is a built-in document editor for drafting and managing text content directly within Pawz. Write markdown, HTML, or plain text, and optionally use AI to improve your writing with one click.

## Document management

### Creating a document

1. Open the **Content** view
2. Click **New Document**
3. Enter a title and select a content type
4. Start writing in the editor

### Content types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Markdown** | Standard markdown formatting |
| **HTML** | Raw HTML content |
| **Plaintext** | Unformatted text |

### Operations

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create** | Start a new document with title and content type |
| **Edit** | Modify the title, type, or content of an existing document |
| **Save** | Persist changes to the database |
| **Delete** | Permanently remove a document |

## Editor

The editor provides a full-width text area optimized for focused writing:

- **Live word count**: Displayed below the editor, updating as you type
- **Title editing**: Click the document title to rename it inline
- **Content type selector**: Switch between markdown, HTML, and plaintext

### Document sidebar

The left sidebar lists all your documents with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Title** | Document name |
| **Word count** | Total words in the document |
| **Last updated** | Timestamp of the most recent edit |

Click any document in the sidebar to open it in the editor.

## AI Improve

The standout feature of Content Studio is **AI Improve** — a one-click button that sends your document content to the chat engine for AI-powered text improvement.

### How it works

1. Write or paste content into the editor
2. Click the **AI Improve** button
3. The content is sent to your active AI model with instructions to improve clarity, grammar, and style
4. The improved version is returned and can be reviewed

:::tip
AI Improve uses your currently configured model and provider. For best results with long-form content, use a capable model like Claude Sonnet or GPT-4o.

## Storage

Documents are stored in the **frontend SQLite** database in the `content_documents` table. This means:

- Documents persist across app restarts
- Documents are stored locally on your machine
- No cloud sync — your content stays private

### Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique document identifier |
| `title` | Text | Document title |
| `content` | Text | Full document content |
| `content_type` | Text | `markdown`, `html`, or `plaintext` |
| `word_count` | Integer | Cached word count |
| `created_at` | Timestamp | Creation time |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp | Last modification time |

:::info
Content Studio documents are separate from Research findings and agent-generated files. They are your personal writing space within Pawz.
