# Google Workspace

Pawz can read/send Gmail, manage Calendar events, browse Drive, read/write Sheets, and call any Google API — all through a service account with domain-wide delegation.

## How It Works

Pawz uses a **Google service account** to authenticate server-to-server with Google APIs. No browser OAuth flow is needed — the agent authenticates silently using a JSON key file you paste into the skill credentials.

The service account impersonates a real Google Workspace user (e.g. `pawz@yourdomain.com`) via **domain-wide delegation**, giving it access to that user's Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc.

## Setup

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click **Select a project** → **New Project**
3. Name it (e.g. "Pawz Agent") and click **Create**
4. Make sure the new project is selected

### 2. Enable APIs

In your project, go to **APIs & Services → Library** and enable these APIs:

- **Gmail API**
- **Google Calendar API**
- **Google Drive API**
- **Google Sheets API**
- **Google Docs API**

Search for each one and click **Enable**.

### 3. Create a Service Account

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Click **+ Create Credentials → Service Account**
3. Name: `pawz-agent` (or whatever you like)
4. Click **Create and Continue**
5. Skip the optional role/access steps, click **Done**

### 4. Create a JSON Key

1. Click on the service account you just created
2. Go to the **Keys** tab
3. Click **Add Key → Create new key → JSON**
4. A `.json` file will download — this is your service account key
5. **Keep this file safe** — it contains a private key

### 5. Set Up Domain-Wide Delegation

This step allows the service account to impersonate users in your Google Workspace domain.

1. On the service account details page, note the **Client ID** (a long number like `118234567890123456789`)
2. Go to [Google Workspace Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/)
3. Navigate to **Security → Access and Data Control → API Controls → Domain-wide Delegation**
4. Click **Add new**
5. Paste the **Client ID** from step 1
6. In **OAuth Scopes**, paste this entire list (comma-separated):

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents
```

7. Click **Authorize**

### 6. Create a Workspace User (Optional)

If you want Pawz to have its own email identity:

1. In Google Workspace Admin, go to **Directory → Users**
2. Click **Add new user**
3. Create an account like `pawz@yourdomain.com`
4. This will be the email Pawz sends from and the mailbox it reads

### 7. Configure in Pawz

1. Open Pawz → **Skills** → **Google Workspace**
2. Click **Enable**, then **Configure**
3. **Service Account JSON**: Open the downloaded `.json` key file in a text editor, copy the entire contents, and paste it into this field
4. **Delegated User Email**: Enter the email of the user the agent should act as (e.g. `pawz@yourdomain.com`)
5. Save

## Available Tools

Once configured, your agents get these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `google_gmail_list` | List/search emails using Gmail search operators |
| `google_gmail_read` | Read the full content of an email by ID |
| `google_gmail_send` | Send emails (plain text or HTML, with CC) |
| `google_calendar_list` | List upcoming events with date range filtering |
| `google_calendar_create` | Create events with attendees, location, description |
| `google_drive_list` | Browse and search Drive files |
| `google_drive_read` | Read document contents (exports Docs/Sheets as text) |
| `google_sheets_read` | Read spreadsheet data as formatted tables |
| `google_sheets_append` | Append rows to a spreadsheet |
| `google_api` | Generic authenticated call to any Google REST API |

## Usage Examples

Ask your agent:

- *"Check my inbox for unread emails"*
- *"Send an email to alice@example.com about the project update"*
- *"What meetings do I have this week?"*
- *"Schedule a team standup for tomorrow at 10am with bob@company.com"*
- *"List the files in my Drive"*
- *"Read the Q4 Report spreadsheet"*
- *"Add a row to the expenses spreadsheet"*

## Gmail Search Operators

The `google_gmail_list` tool supports Gmail search syntax:

| Operator | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `from:` | `from:alice@example.com` | Emails from a sender |
| `to:` | `to:bob@example.com` | Emails to a recipient |
| `subject:` | `subject:invoice` | Emails with subject containing word |
| `is:unread` | `is:unread` | Unread emails only |
| `is:starred` | `is:starred` | Starred emails |
| `has:attachment` | `has:attachment` | Emails with attachments |
| `after:` | `after:2025/01/01` | Emails after a date |
| `before:` | `before:2025/06/01` | Emails before a date |
| `label:` | `label:important` | Emails with a label |

Combine operators: `from:alice@example.com is:unread has:attachment`

## Security Notes

- The service account JSON key contains a **private RSA key** — treat it like a password
- Credentials are encrypted at rest in Pawz's skill vault (AES-256-GCM)
- The service account can only access the delegated user's data — not other users in the domain
- Access tokens are cached in-memory for 1 hour and never written to disk
- You can revoke access at any time by deleting the service account key in Google Cloud Console

## Troubleshooting

**"Missing SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON credential"**
→ Enable the Google Workspace skill and paste the JSON key in Skills → Configure

**"Google token exchange failed (401)"**
→ The service account key may be invalid or expired. Generate a new JSON key in Google Cloud Console.

**"Google API error (403): Insufficient Permission"**
→ Domain-wide delegation scopes may not be configured. Check step 5 — make sure all scopes are authorized in Google Workspace Admin.

**"Google API error (400): Bad Request"**
→ For calendar events, make sure dates are in RFC3339 format: `2026-02-24T10:00:00-05:00`

**"Token response missing 'access_token'"**
→ The Gmail/Calendar/Drive APIs may not be enabled. Check step 2 in Google Cloud Console.
