# Google Workspace

Connect Pawz to Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets, and Docs. He can read your inbox, send emails, schedule meetings, browse files, and read/write spreadsheets — all hands-free.

## What Pawz Can Do With Google

Once connected, Pawz gets 10 Google tools:

**Email (Gmail)**
- Read your inbox, search for specific emails ("find all unread emails from Sarah")
- Read full email contents
- Send emails as your Pawz account (to anyone, with CC, plain text or HTML)

**Calendar**
- See your upcoming schedule ("what meetings do I have this week?")
- Create events with attendees, location, and description

**Drive**
- Browse and search your Google Drive files
- Read the contents of Docs, Sheets, PDFs, and text files

**Sheets**
- Read spreadsheet data (shows as formatted tables)
- Add new rows to spreadsheets (great for logging, tracking, data entry)

**Any Google API**
- A generic tool that can hit any Google REST API endpoint for anything not covered above

## Requirements

<Callout type="warn">
This setup requires **Google Workspace** (the paid Google business plan — starts at $7/mo per user). If you're using a free `@gmail.com` account, this method won't work — service accounts can't impersonate personal Gmail users. OAuth2 support for personal Gmail is planned for a future release.
</Callout>

You need:
- A **Google Workspace** domain (e.g. `yourdomain.com` managed through Google)
- **Admin access** to that Google Workspace account
- About **15 minutes** for first-time setup

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

This is where Google tracks which APIs your service account can use.

1. Open this link: **[console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)**
2. You'll see a "New Project" form:
   - **Project name**: Type `Pawz` (or anything you want)
   - **Organization**: Leave as your domain (it may auto-select)
3. Click the blue **Create** button
4. Wait a few seconds — a notification will pop up saying "Create Project: Pawz". Click **SELECT PROJECT** in that notification.

You should now see "Pawz" in the top-left dropdown next to the Google Cloud logo.

### Step 2: Turn On the APIs

You need to flip the switch on for each Google service Pawz will use. This is just clicking "Enable" 5 times.

Click each of these links (they'll open the right page for your new project). On each page, click the blue **Enable** button:

1. **[Enable Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)**
2. **[Enable Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com)**
3. **[Enable Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com)**
4. **[Enable Sheets API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com)**
5. **[Enable Docs API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/docs.googleapis.com)**

If any of them say "API Enabled" already, you're good — just move on.

<Callout type="info">
Make sure "Pawz" is still selected as your project in the top-left dropdown before clicking Enable. If it switched, click the dropdown and select Pawz.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Create the Service Account

A service account is like a robot user — it's what Pawz uses to log in to Google without needing a browser.

1. Open: **[console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create)**
2. Fill in:
   - **Service account name**: `pawz-agent`
   - **Service account ID**: This auto-fills to `pawz-agent` (leave it)
   - **Description**: `Pawz AI agent access` (optional)
3. Click **Create and Continue**
4. On the "Grant this service account access" step — **skip it**. Just click **Continue**.
5. On the "Grant users access" step — **skip it**. Click **Done**.

You'll be taken to a list of service accounts. You should see `pawz-agent@pawz-XXXXX.iam.gserviceaccount.com` in the list.

### Step 4: Download the JSON Key

This is the credential file that Pawz needs. It contains a private key that lets Pawz authenticate.

1. You should be on the Service Accounts list page. If not, open: **[console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)**
2. Click on **pawz-agent** (the email link in the table)
3. Click the **Keys** tab at the top
4. Click **Add Key** → **Create new key**
5. Select **JSON** (it's the default)
6. Click **Create**
7. A `.json` file will automatically download to your computer (something like `pawz-XXXXX-abc123.json`)

**Keep this file!** You'll paste its contents into Pawz in the last step.

### Step 5: Enable Domain-Wide Delegation

This is the step that gives the service account permission to act as a real user in your Google Workspace domain. Without this, the service account can't access Gmail, Calendar, etc.

**Part A — Get the Client ID:**

1. Go back to: **[console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)**
2. In the service accounts table, find `pawz-agent`
3. Look at the **OAuth 2 Client ID** column — it's a long number like `118234567890123456789`
4. **Copy that number** (click the copy icon or select and Ctrl+C)

If you don't see the OAuth 2 Client ID column:
- Click on `pawz-agent` → **Details** tab → look for **Unique ID** — that's the same number

**Part B — Authorize in Google Workspace Admin:**

1. Open: **[admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation)**
   - You need to be logged in as a Google Workspace admin for your domain
2. Click **Add new**
3. **Client ID**: Paste the number you copied in Part A
4. **OAuth scopes**: Copy and paste this entire line:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents
```

5. Click **Authorize**

You should see `pawz-agent` appear in the domain-wide delegation list with "6 scopes".

### Step 6: Create Pawz's Email Account (Optional but Recommended)

If you want Pawz to have his **own** email address (like `pawz@yourdomain.com`) instead of acting as your personal account:

1. Open: **[admin.google.com/ac/users](https://admin.google.com/ac/users)**
2. Click **Add new user**
3. Fill in:
   - **First name**: `Pawz`
   - **Last name**: `Agent` (or your pick)
   - **Primary email**: `pawz@yourdomain.com`
4. Set a password (you won't need it — Pawz uses the service account to log in)
5. Click **Add new user**

This gives Pawz his own Gmail inbox, Calendar, and Drive.

### Step 7: Connect in Pawz

Almost done — now just paste the credentials into Pawz.

1. Open **Pawz** on your desktop
2. Go to **Skills** (in the sidebar)
3. Find **Google Workspace** and click **Enable**
4. Click **Configure**
5. You'll see two fields:

**Service Account JSON:**
- Open the `.json` file you downloaded in Step 4 with any text editor (TextEdit, Notepad, VS Code — anything)
- Select **all** the text (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A) and **copy** it (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)
- Paste it into this field
- It should start with `{"type": "service_account"` and contain a long `private_key` section

**Delegated User Email:**
- If you created `pawz@yourdomain.com` in Step 6, enter: `pawz@yourdomain.com`
- Otherwise, enter your own Google Workspace email (e.g. `you@yourdomain.com`)
- This is the account Pawz will "act as" — reading that inbox, sending from that address, etc.

6. Click **Save**

### Done!

Try it out — tell Pawz:
- *"Check my inbox"*
- *"What's on my calendar this week?"*
- *"Send an email to hello@example.com saying hi from Pawz"*
- *"What files are in my Google Drive?"*

---

## Gmail Search Tips

When asking Pawz to find specific emails, he uses Gmail's search syntax under the hood. You can be natural about it:

| What you say | What Pawz searches |
|---|---|
| "Find unread emails" | `is:unread` |
| "Emails from Sarah" | `from:sarah@...` |
| "Emails about invoices" | `subject:invoice` |
| "Emails with attachments from last week" | `has:attachment after:2026/02/16` |
| "Starred emails" | `is:starred` |

---

## Security

- The JSON key is **encrypted** in Pawz's credential vault (AES-256-GCM) — it's not stored in plain text
- Access tokens live in memory only, never written to disk, and expire after 1 hour
- The service account can **only** access the one delegated user's data — it can't snoop on other people in your org
- To revoke access: delete the key in Google Cloud Console, or remove the delegation in Workspace Admin

## Troubleshooting

**"Missing SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON credential"**
You haven't pasted the JSON key yet. Go to Skills → Google Workspace → Configure and paste the full contents of the `.json` file.

**"Failed to parse service account private key"**
The JSON got corrupted during copy-paste. Open the `.json` file again, make sure you're copying the **entire** file (including the curly braces at the start and end), and try again.

**"Google token exchange failed (401)"**
The service account key might be expired or revoked. Go to Google Cloud Console → Service Accounts → Keys and create a new JSON key.

**"Google API error (403): Insufficient Permission"**
Domain-wide delegation isn't set up correctly. Go back to Step 5 and make sure:
- The Client ID matches exactly
- All 6 OAuth scopes are pasted (no extra spaces or line breaks)
- You clicked Authorize

**"Google API error (403)" on Gmail specifically**
The Gmail API might not be enabled. Go to Step 2 and click the Gmail API link to verify it says "API Enabled".

**"Google API error (400): Bad Request" on calendar events**
Calendar times need to be in a specific format. Tell Pawz to use times like "tomorrow at 2pm" and he'll handle the formatting.

**"Token response missing 'access_token'"**
One or more APIs aren't enabled. Revisit Step 2 and click through all 5 links to make sure each says "API Enabled".
