# Google Workspace

Connect Pawz to Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets, and Docs. He can read your inbox, send emails, schedule meetings, browse files, and read/write spreadsheets — all hands-free.

## What Pawz Can Do With Google

Once connected, Pawz gets 10 Google tools:

**Email (Gmail)**
- Read your inbox, search for specific emails ("find all unread emails from Sarah")
- Read full email contents
- Send emails as you (to anyone, with CC, plain text or HTML)

**Calendar**
- See your upcoming schedule ("what meetings do I have this week?")
- Create events with attendees, location, and description

**Drive**
- Browse and search your Google Drive files
- Read the contents of Docs, Sheets, PDFs, and text files

**Sheets**
- Read spreadsheet data (shows as formatted tables)
- Add new rows to spreadsheets (great for logging, tracking, data entry)

**Any Google API**
- A generic tool that can hit any Google REST API endpoint for anything not covered above

## Quick Setup (OAuth — Recommended)

This works with any Google account — personal `@gmail.com` or Google Workspace.

<Callout type="info">
**Time needed:** About 5 minutes. You'll create an OAuth Client ID in Google Cloud Console, then click "Connect with Google" in Pawz.
</Callout>

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Open **[console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)**
2. **Project name**: Type `Pawz`
3. Click **Create**
4. Wait a few seconds — click **SELECT PROJECT** in the notification that appears

### Step 2: Enable the APIs

Click each link and hit the blue **Enable** button:

1. **[Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)**
2. **[Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com)**
3. **[Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com)**
4. **[Sheets API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com)**
5. **[Docs API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/docs.googleapis.com)**

If any say "API Enabled" already, skip it.

### Step 3: Set Up the OAuth Consent Screen

1. Open **[console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)**
2. Choose **External** (or **Internal** if you're on Google Workspace and only want org users)
3. Click **Create**
4. Fill in:
   - **App name**: `Pawz`
   - **User support email**: Select your email
   - **Developer contact email**: Enter your email
5. Click **Save and Continue**
6. On the **Scopes** page — click **Add or Remove Scopes**, then add these URLs (paste each one):
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
7. Click **Update** → **Save and Continue**
8. On the **Test users** page — click **Add Users**, type your Gmail/Workspace email, click **Add** → **Save and Continue**

<Callout type="warn">
While your app is in "Testing" mode, only the test users you add can sign in. This is fine for personal use. If you need more users, you can submit the app for verification later.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Create an OAuth Client ID

1. Open **[console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient)**
2. **Application type**: Select **Desktop app**
3. **Name**: `Pawz Desktop`
4. Click **Create**
5. You'll see a popup with your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** — **copy both** (click the copy icons)

<Callout type="info">
You can always find these again at [console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) → click on "Pawz Desktop".
</Callout>

### Step 5: Connect in Pawz

1. Open **Pawz** on your desktop
2. Go to **Skills** → find **Google Workspace** → **Enable** it → click **Configure**
3. Paste your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the fields
4. Click **Set** for each one
5. Click **Connect with Google**
6. Your browser opens → sign in with Google → click **Allow**
7. The browser says "Pawz Connected!" — you can close it
8. Back in Pawz, you'll see **"Connected as you@gmail.com"**

### Done!

Try it out:
- *"Check my inbox"*
- *"What's on my calendar this week?"*
- *"Send an email to hello@example.com saying hi"*
- *"What files are in my Google Drive?"*

## Gmail Search Tips

When asking Pawz to find specific emails, he uses Gmail's search syntax under the hood:

| What you say | What Pawz searches |
|---|---|
| "Find unread emails" | `is:unread` |
| "Emails from Sarah" | `from:sarah@...` |
| "Emails about invoices" | `subject:invoice` |
| "Emails with attachments from last week" | `has:attachment after:2026/02/16` |
| "Starred emails" | `is:starred` |

---

## Security

- Your refresh token is **encrypted** in Pawz's credential vault (AES-256-GCM) — not stored in plain text
- Access tokens live in memory only, never written to disk, and expire after 1 hour
- To disconnect: go to Skills → Google Workspace → **Disconnect**, or revoke at [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

---

## Enterprise Setup (Service Account)

<Callout type="warn">
This is the advanced option for **Google Workspace admins** who want server-to-server auth with domain-wide delegation. Most users should use the OAuth flow above.
</Callout>

If you need Pawz to act as a dedicated robot user (e.g. `pawz@yourdomain.com`) without interactive login — use a service account.

### Create the Service Account

1. Complete Steps 1–2 above (project + APIs)
2. Open **[console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create)**
3. **Name**: `pawz-agent` → Click **Create and Continue** → **Skip** both grant steps → **Done**
4. Click on `pawz-agent` → **Keys** tab → **Add Key** → **Create new key** → **JSON** → **Create**
5. A `.json` file downloads — keep it safe

### Enable Domain-Wide Delegation

1. On the service accounts page, copy the **OAuth 2 Client ID** (long number) for `pawz-agent`
2. Open **[admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation)** (requires Workspace admin)
3. Click **Add new**:
   - **Client ID**: Paste the number
   - **Scopes**: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`
4. Click **Authorize**

### (Optional) Create Pawz's Email

1. Open **[admin.google.com/ac/users](https://admin.google.com/ac/users)** → **Add new user**
2. Create `pawz@yourdomain.com`

### Connect in Pawz

1. Go to **Skills** → **Google Workspace** → **Configure**
2. Open the **Enterprise — Service Account** section at the bottom
3. Paste the full JSON key file contents and the delegated email
4. Click **Set** for each field

## Troubleshooting

**"Connect with Google" opens browser but nothing happens**
Make sure you added your email as a test user in the OAuth consent screen (Step 3.8).

**"Google OAuth failed: Token exchange failed"**
The Client ID or Secret may be wrong. Go to [console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) → click on your OAuth client → copy the values again.

**"Google API error (403): Insufficient Permission"**
One or more APIs aren't enabled. Go back to Step 2 and verify all 5 say "API Enabled".

**"Google API error (403)" on Gmail specifically**
Gmail requires the `gmail.modify` and `gmail.send` scopes. Make sure they're listed in your consent screen scopes (Step 3.6).

**"Access denied" or "This app isn't verified" warning**
This is normal for apps in Testing mode. Click **Advanced** → **Go to Pawz (unsafe)** to proceed. Only test users you added will see this.

**Calendar times are wrong**
Tell Pawz to use natural language like "tomorrow at 2pm" — he'll format it correctly as RFC3339.
