# Foundry — Models & Chat Modes

The Foundry is your control center for managing AI providers and creating reusable chat mode presets. It provides two tabs: **Models** and **Chat Modes**.

## Models tab

The Models tab displays all configured AI providers as cards, giving you a quick overview of your setup.

### Provider cards

Each provider card shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Kind** | Provider type (e.g. `anthropic`, `openai`, `ollama`, `google`) |
| **Endpoint** | Base URL for the provider API |
| **Model** | Currently selected model |
| **Key status** | Whether an API key is configured (shown as a badge) |
| **Default badge** | Indicates if this is your default provider |

### Supported providers

| Provider | Kind | Default Endpoint |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| Ollama | `ollama` | `http://localhost:11434` |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | `https://api.anthropic.com` |
| Google | `google` | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta` |
| DeepSeek | `deepseek` | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` |
| xAI (Grok) | `grok` | `https://api.x.ai/v1` |
| Mistral | `mistral` | `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` |
| Moonshot/Kimi | `moonshot` | `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1` |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| Custom | `custom` | User-defined |

### Setting a default provider

To set a provider as default, go to **Settings → Advanced**, find the provider card, and click **Make Default**. The default provider is used for all conversations unless overridden by an agent or chat mode.

## Chat Modes tab

Chat Modes are named presets that let you instantly switch between different conversation configurations. Think of them as "profiles" for how the AI behaves.

### Mode properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the mode |
| **Model** | AI model to use when this mode is active |
| **System prompt** | Custom system prompt injected for this mode |
| **Thinking level** | AI reasoning depth: `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| **Temperature** | Randomness control (0.0–2.0) |
| **Icon** | Emoji or symbol for quick identification |
| **Color** | Visual accent color for the mode |

### Creating a chat mode

1. Open the **Foundry** view
2. Switch to the **Chat Modes** tab
3. Click **New Mode**
4. Fill in the mode properties in the form modal
5. Save

### Example modes

| Mode | Model | Temperature | Thinking | Use case |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Quick Chat | `claude-3-haiku` | 0.7 | none | Fast, lightweight responses |
| Deep Analysis | `claude-opus-4-6` | 0.3 | high | Complex reasoning tasks |
| Creative Writing | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 1.0 | medium | Stories, brainstorming |
| Code Review | `gpt-4o` | 0.2 | low | Precise, technical feedback |

### Managing modes

- **Edit**: Click a mode card to open the edit form
- **Delete**: Remove a mode you no longer need
- **Switch**: Use the `/mode <name>` slash command to activate a mode during conversation

```
/mode Deep Analysis
```

### Storage

Chat modes are stored in the **frontend SQLite** database in the `agent_modes` table. This means they persist across sessions and are available immediately on app restart.

:::tip
Create a "Cost Saver" mode with a cheap model like `claude-3-haiku` or `gpt-4o-mini` for simple tasks, and a "Heavy Lifting" mode with a powerful model for complex work. Switch between them with `/mode` to manage costs.
:::

:::info
Chat modes override the default provider/model for the duration of the conversation. Agent-specific model overrides take highest priority over chat modes.
