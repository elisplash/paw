# Modular Workspace

Pawz ships with 17 navigation views, but not every user needs all of them. A trader doesn't need Content Studio. A marketer doesn't need Trading. A developer doesn't need either. The modular workspace lets you configure exactly which views appear in your sidebar.

## Workspace Profiles

Choose a preset profile or build a custom one:

### All (Default)

Every view is visible. This is the out-of-the-box experience.

### Developer

Focused on coding, research, and orchestration.

| Visible | Hidden |
|---------|--------|
| Dashboard, Chat, Agents, Tasks, Projects, Research, Orchestrator, Nodes, Memory Palace, Automations, Skills, Foundry, Settings | Trading, Content Studio, Mail |

### Marketer

Focused on content creation, email, and research.

| Visible | Hidden |
|---------|--------|
| Dashboard, Chat, Agents, Tasks, Content Studio, Mail, Research, Automations, Channels, Skills, Foundry, Settings | Trading, Projects, Nodes, Orchestrator |

### Trader

Focused on trading, research, and automation.

| Visible | Hidden |
|---------|--------|
| Dashboard, Chat, Agents, Tasks, Trading, Research, Automations, Memory Palace, Channels, Skills, Foundry, Settings | Content Studio, Projects, Nodes, Mail |

### Minimal

Just the essentials — chat with your agents and manage skills.

| Visible | Hidden |
|---------|--------|
| Dashboard, Chat, Agents, Tasks, Skills, Settings | Everything else |

### Custom

Pick exactly which views to show. A checkbox grid in Settings lets you toggle each view individually.

## Core Views (Always Visible)

These views cannot be hidden regardless of profile. They are fundamental to how Pawz works:

| View | Why it's always visible |
|------|------------------------|
| **Dashboard** | Landing page, weather, tasks, skill widgets |
| **Chat** | Primary agent interaction |
| **Agents** | Manage agent identities, soul files, policies |
| **Skills** | Enable/disable skills, PawzHub browser, credential setup |
| **Settings** | App configuration, models, providers, workspace profile selector |

## How to Configure

1. Open **Settings → Advanced** (or the dedicated **Workspace** settings tab)
2. Choose a **Workspace Profile** from the dropdown:
   - All, Developer, Marketer, Trader, Minimal, Custom
3. If **Custom** is selected, a checkbox grid appears with all 17 views
4. Toggle views on/off — changes apply immediately
5. The sidebar updates in real-time

:::tip
Hit **Reset to Default** at any time to go back to the "All" profile with every view visible.

## Use Cases

### Solo Developer

**Profile:** Developer

Your sidebar has Chat, Agents, Projects, Tasks, Orchestrator, Research, Nodes, and Memory Palace. No Trading, no Content Studio, no Mail. Clean and focused.

Add skills from PawzHub for your stack: GitHub, Vercel, Supabase, Cloudflare. Their widgets show deployment status and incident logs right on your dashboard.

### Marketing Team Lead

**Profile:** Marketer

Your sidebar has Chat, Agents, Content Studio, Mail, Research, Tasks, Automations, Channels. No Trading, no Projects, no Nodes.

Add skills for your platforms: X/Twitter, SendGrid, Shopify, Google Analytics. Dashboard widgets show engagement metrics, email delivery rates, and revenue.

### Crypto Trader

**Profile:** Trader

Your sidebar has Chat, Agents, Trading, Research, Tasks, Automations, Memory Palace, Channels. No Content Studio, no Projects, no Nodes.

Built-in DEX and Coinbase skills are already there. Add PawzHub skills for additional exchanges, whale tracking, or portfolio analytics. Widgets show portfolio value, open positions, and price alerts.

### Power User

**Profile:** All or Custom

Keep everything visible, or fine-tune with Custom to hide just the one or two views you never use.

## Skill-Driven Views (Coming Soon)

In a future update, community skills will be able to register their own custom views in the sidebar. For example, a "CRM" skill could add a dedicated CRM tab with pipeline visualization, or a "Home Dashboard" skill could add a smart home control panel.

For now, the modular workspace controls visibility of the 17 built-in views. Custom skill views are planned for Phase 6 of the PawzHub roadmap.

## FAQ

**Does changing my profile affect my data?**
No. Hidden views still exist — their data is preserved. If you hide Trading and later show it again, all your trading history and settings are still there.

**Can I have different profiles for different agents?**
Not yet. The workspace profile is app-wide. Per-agent workspace profiles are planned for a future update.

**What happens if I navigate to a hidden view?**
You can't. Hidden views have no nav item. If a skill or automation tries to switch to a hidden view, you're redirected to the Dashboard.

**Can skills add new views?**
Not yet. This is planned for Phase 6 (custom skill views). For now, skills output data via dashboard widgets and chat.
