# Providers

Providers are the AI backends that power your agents. Pawz supports 10 providers and any OpenAI-compatible API.

## Supported providers

| Provider | Default Base URL | Auth |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| [Ollama](/ollama) | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | None (local) |
| [OpenAI](/openai) | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | API key |
| [Anthropic](/anthropic) | `https://api.anthropic.com/v1` | API key |
| [Google](/google) | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta` | API key |
| [OpenRouter](/openrouter) | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | API key |
| [DeepSeek](/deepseek) | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` | API key |
| [Grok](/grok) | `https://api.x.ai/v1` | API key |
| [Mistral](/mistral) | `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` | API key |
| [Moonshot](/moonshot) | `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1` | API key |
| [Custom](/custom) | You provide | You provide |

## Adding a provider

1. Go to **Settings → Models**
2. Click **Add Provider**
3. Select the provider type
4. Enter your API key
5. Optionally set a default model and custom base URL

## Model routing

Pawz can automatically route requests to different models based on the context:

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Boss model** | Expensive, powerful — used for orchestrator bosses |
| **Worker model** | Cheap, fast — used for channel responses and workers |
| **Specialty models** | Per-specialty overrides (e.g., `coder` → `gemini-2.5-pro`) |
| **Agent models** | Per-agent overrides (highest priority) |
| **Cheap model** | Simple tasks auto-select this model |
| **Auto-tier** | Automatically pick cheap vs. expensive based on task complexity |

**Resolution priority:** agent_models > specialty_models > role-based (boss/worker) > fallback

## Smart prefix matching

When you type a model name, Pawz auto-routes to the right provider:

| Pattern | Routes to |
|---------|-----------|
| `claude*` / `anthropic*` | Anthropic |
| `gemini*` / `google*` | Google |
| `gpt*` / `o1*` / `o3*` / `o4*` | OpenAI |
| Contains `/` (e.g., `meta-llama/llama-3.1`) | OpenRouter |
| Contains `:` (e.g., `llama3.1:8b`) | Ollama |
| Other | Default provider → first configured |

## Provider fallback

If a provider returns a billing, authentication, or rate limit error, Pawz automatically tries other configured providers before failing. This ensures your agents stay responsive even if one provider has issues.

## Budget enforcement

Set a daily budget in **Settings → Engine**:

| Threshold | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 50% | Warning notification |
| 75% | Warning notification |
| 90% | Warning notification |
| 100% | Requests blocked |

Set to `0` to disable budget limits.

## Multiple providers

You can configure as many providers as you want. Benefits:

- Use different models for different agents
- Automatic fallback if one provider is down
- Mix local (Ollama) and cloud providers
- Use cheap models for routine tasks, expensive for complex ones
