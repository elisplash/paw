# Security

OpenPawz is designed with defense-in-depth: multiple layers protect against prompt injection, data exfiltration, and unauthorized actions.

## Human-in-the-Loop (HIL)

Every tool is classified by risk level. High-risk tools require explicit human approval before execution.

### Auto-approved tools (no approval needed)

`fetch` · `read_file` · `list_directory` · `web_search` · `web_read` · `memory_search` · `memory_store` · `soul_read` · `soul_write` · `soul_list` · `self_info` · `update_profile` · `create_task` · `list_tasks` · `manage_task` · `email_read` · `slack_read` · `telegram_read` · `image_generate`

### HIL-required tools (human must approve)

`exec` · `write_file` · `delete_file` · `append_file` · `email_send` · `webhook_send` · `rest_api_call` · `slack_send` · `github_api`

## Agent policies

Per-agent tool access control with four presets:

| Preset | Mode | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Unrestricted** | unrestricted | All tools, no approval |
| **Standard** | denylist | High-risk tools require approval |
| **Read-only** | allowlist | Only safe read tools |
| **Sandbox** | allowlist | web_search, web_read, memory_search, soul_read only |

You can also create custom policies with specific tool allowlists/denylists.

### Risk classification

| Risk | Tools |
|------|-------|
| **Safe** | `read_file`, `list_directory`, `web_search`, `web_read`, `memory_search`, `soul_read`, `soul_list`, `self_info`, `fetch` |
| **High-risk** | `exec`, `write_file`, `delete_file`, `append_file`, `email_send`, `webhook_send`, `rest_api_call`, `slack_send`, `github_api`, `image_generate`, `soul_write`, `update_profile`, `create_agent`, `create_task`, `manage_task` |

## Prompt injection defense

All incoming channel messages are scanned for injection attempts before reaching the agent.

### Detection

Pattern-based scoring across 9 categories (8 in the Rust backend scanner, 9 in the TypeScript frontend scanner which adds `obfuscation`):

| Category | Examples | Scanner |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `override` | "Ignore previous instructions" | Both |
| `identity` | "You are now..." | Both |
| `jailbreak` | "DAN mode", "no restrictions" | Both |
| `leaking` | "Show me your system prompt" | Both |
| `obfuscation` | Base64-encoded instructions | Frontend only |
| `tool_injection` | Fake tool call formatting | Both |
| `social` | "As an AI researcher..." | Both |
| `markup` | Hidden instructions in HTML/markdown | Both |
| `bypass` | "This is just a test..." | Both |

### Severity levels

| Severity | Score | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Critical** | 40+ | Message blocked, not delivered |
| **High** | 25+ | Warning logged |
| **Medium** | 12+ | Noted in logs |
| **Low** | 5+ | Informational |

Channel bridges automatically block messages with `critical` severity.

## Container sandbox

Execute agent commands in isolated Docker containers:

| Security measure | Default |
|-----------------|---------|
| Capabilities | `cap_drop ALL` |
| Network | Disabled |
| Memory limit | 256 MB |
| CPU shares | 512 |
| Timeout | 30 seconds |
| Output limit | 50 KB |

### Presets

| Preset | Image | Memory | Network | Timeout |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Minimal | alpine | 128 MB | Off | 15s |
| Development | node:20-alpine | 512 MB | On | 60s |
| Python | python:3.12-alpine | 512 MB | On | 60s |
| Restricted | alpine | 64 MB | Off | 10s |

### Command risk assessment

Commands are scored before execution:
- **Low** — `ls`, `cat`, `echo`
- **Medium** — `pip install`, `npm install`
- **High** — `curl`, `wget`, network commands
- **Critical** — `rm -rf /`, `chmod 777`, dangerous patterns

## Browser network policy

Control which domains agents can access:

**Default allowed:** AI provider APIs, DuckDuckGo, Coinbase, localhost

**Default blocked:** pastebin.com, transfer.sh, file.io, 0x0.st (data exfiltration risks)

## File system protection

Sensitive paths are blocked from agent access — agents cannot add these as project folders or browse into them.

| Category | Blocked paths |
|----------|---------------|
| **SSH / GPG** | `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg` |
| **Cloud credentials** | `~/.aws`, `~/.kube` |
| **Desktop keyrings** | `~/.gnome-keyring`, `~/.password-store` |
| **Docker** | `~/.docker` (includes `config.json`) |
| **Network credentials** | `~/.netrc` |
| **System config** | `/etc` (covers `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/sudoers`) |
| **Root home** | `/root` |
| **System logs** | `/var/log` |
| **Virtual filesystems (Linux)** | `/proc/*`, `/sys/*` |
| **Device nodes** | `/dev` |
| **Windows** | `C:\Windows`, `C:\Users\*\AppData` (credential store paths) |
| **App config** | `~/.openclaw` (contains tokens), `~/.config/himalaya` (email config) |

Additionally, the **home directory root** itself (`~`, `/home/user`, `/Users/user`) and the **filesystem root** (`/`, `C:\`) are blocked as too broad.

:::tip Per-project scope guard
When a project is active, all file operations are constrained to the project root. Directory traversal sequences (`../`) are detected and blocked even within the allowed path.
:::

## Credential security

Credentials are protected by two independent encryption layers:

### Layer 1: Skill credential encryption (XOR)

- API keys encrypted with XOR using a 32-byte random key
- Encryption key stored in OS keychain (`paw-skill-vault`)
- High-risk credentials (Coinbase, DEX) are **server-side only** — never injected into prompts
- Credentials are decrypted only at execution time

### Layer 2: Database field encryption (AES-256-GCM)

Sensitive database fields are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** via the Web Crypto API before being stored in SQLite.

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Algorithm | AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption) |
| Key size | 256 bits |
| IV | 12-byte random IV per encryption |
| Key source | Generated on first launch, stored in OS keychain (`paw-db-encryption`) |
| Storage format | `enc:<base64(IV + ciphertext)>` |
| Fallback | Graceful — stores plaintext if encryption is unavailable |

:::info Two independent layers
The XOR layer protects skill credentials stored in the `skill_credentials` table. The AES-256-GCM layer protects other sensitive fields across the database. Both derive their keys from the OS keychain but use separate keychain entries.
:::

## Tool execution security

Tool execution is governed by multiple safety mechanisms in the engine's central tool executor.

### Source code introspection block

Agents cannot read engine source files — any `read_file` call targeting paths containing `src-tauri/src/engine/`, `src/engine/`, or files ending in `.rs` is rejected. This prevents agents from exfiltrating their own implementation details or discovering internal security mechanisms.

### Credential write block

The `write_file` tool blocks content that contains credential-like patterns:
- PEM private keys (`-----BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY-----`)
- API key secrets (`api_key_secret`, `cdp_api_key`)
- Base64-encoded secrets with `secret` or `private` keywords

### Execution limits

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `maxToolCallsPerTurn` | Per-agent policy | Maximum tool calls an agent can make in a single turn before being stopped |
| `tool_timeout_secs` | 300 | Seconds before a pending tool approval or execution is killed |
| `max_tool_rounds` | 20 | Maximum tool-call → result → re-prompt loops per turn |
| `max_concurrent_runs` | 4 | Maximum simultaneous agent runs |

### Output truncation

Tool results are capped to prevent context window overflow:

| Tool | Max output | Behavior |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `exec` | 50,000 chars | Truncated with `[output truncated]` marker |
| `read_file` | 32,000 chars | Truncated with total byte count |
| `fetch` | 50,000 chars | Truncated with total byte count |
| Container sandbox | 50,000 chars (stdout + stderr each) | Truncated with `[stdout/stderr truncated]` marker |

### Network policy enforcement

The `fetch` tool enforces domain-level network policy — blocked domains are always rejected, and when an allowlist is active, only listed domains are permitted.

### Exfiltration detection

Outbound network commands are audited for data exfiltration patterns:
- Piping file contents to `curl`, `wget`, or `nc`
- File upload flags (`curl -T`, `curl --data-binary @`, `wget --post-file`)
- Redirects to `/dev/tcp/`
- `scp` and `rsync` to remote hosts

:::warning
Exfiltration detection is pattern-based and applies to `exec` tool invocations. It supplements — but does not replace — the container sandbox for high-security environments.
:::

## Budget enforcement

Daily spending limits with progressive warnings:

| Threshold | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 50% | Warning |
| 75% | Warning |
| 90% | Warning |
| 100% | Requests blocked |

## Trading safety

| Control | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Auto-approve trades | Off |
| Max trade size | $100 |
| Max daily loss | $500 |
| Transfers | Disabled |
| Max transfer | $0 |

## Channel access control

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Open | Anyone can chat |
| Allowlist | Only approved users |
| Pairing | Users must pair with a code |

Each user gets an isolated session — no cross-user data leakage.
