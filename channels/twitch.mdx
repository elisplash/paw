# Twitch

Connect to Twitch chat so viewers can interact with your agents during streams.

## Setup

1. Create a Twitch account for your bot (or use your own)
2. Generate an OAuth token at [twitchapps.com/tmi](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
3. In Pawz, go to **Settings → Channels**
4. Select **Twitch**
5. Enter:
   - **Username** — bot's Twitch username
   - **OAuth token** — from step 2
   - **Channel** — Twitch channel to join (your stream channel)
6. Start the channel

## Configuration

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Username | Yes | Bot's Twitch username |
| OAuth token | Yes | Twitch OAuth token |
| Channel | Yes | Channel name to join |
| DM policy | Yes | Who can interact |
| Allowed users | For allowlist | Twitch usernames |

## Features

- Twitch IRC chat integration
- Per-user sessions with memory
- Prompt injection scanning
- Agent routing via channel routing rules
- Responds to mentions and commands

## Tips

- Set the DM policy to **open** for public stream interaction
- Use an allowlist if you only want moderators or subscribers to interact
- Messages are limited to Twitch's 500 character max — long responses are auto-split
- Consider rate limiting to avoid flooding chat
