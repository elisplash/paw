# Channels

Channels connect your Pawz agents to messaging platforms. Users on those platforms can chat with your agents directly.

## Supported channels

| [Matrix](/matrix) | Client-Server API | Decentralized chat |
| [IRC](/irc) | IRC protocol | Classic chat rooms |
| [Mattermost](/mattermost) | WebSocket API | Self-hosted teams |
| [Nextcloud](/nextcloud) | Talk API | Nextcloud users |
| [Nostr](/nostr) | NIP relay protocol | Decentralized social |
| [Twitch](/twitch) | IRC + API | Live streaming chat |
| [Webchat](/webchat) | HTTP/WebSocket | Your own website |
| [WhatsApp](/whatsapp) | Evolution API (Docker) | Personal & group messaging |

## How channels work

```
External message arrives
        ↓
Prompt injection scan (block critical threats)
        ↓
Access control check (open / allowlist / pairing)
        ↓
Route to agent (first-match routing rules)
        ↓
Create per-user, per-agent session
        ↓
Auto-recall memories for this user
        ↓
Agent responds via worker_model
        ↓
Auto-capture memorable facts
        ↓
Provider fallback on errors
        ↓
Split response for platform limits
```

## DM policies

Control who can message your agents:

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Open** | Anyone can chat |
| **Allowlist** | Only approved users |
| **Pairing** | Users must pair with a code |

## Channel routing

Route messages to specific agents based on rules:

1. Go to **Settings → Channels**
2. Add routing rules with filters:
   - **Channel** — which platform
   - **User filter** — specific users
   - **Channel ID filter** — specific channels/groups
   - **Agent** — which agent handles it

Rules are evaluated **first-match-wins** — the first matching rule determines the agent.

## Security

- All incoming messages are scanned for prompt injection
- Messages with `critical` severity are blocked automatically
- Each user gets an isolated session (no cross-user contamination)
- Access control is per-channel and per-user
- Channel agents use `worker_model` by default (cheaper, faster)

## Provider fallback

If the primary provider fails (billing, auth, or rate limit errors), Pawz automatically tries other configured providers before failing.
