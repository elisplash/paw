## Setup

1. Choose an IRC network (Libera.Chat, OFTC, etc.)
2. In Pawz, go to **Settings → Channels**
3. Select **IRC**
4. Enter:
   - **Server** — e.g., `irc.libera.chat`
   - **Port** — typically `6697` (TLS) or `6667` (plain)
   - **Nickname** — bot's IRC nick
   - **Channels** — comma-separated channels to join (e.g., `#pawz,#general`)
   - **Use TLS** — enable for encrypted connections
5. Start the channel
