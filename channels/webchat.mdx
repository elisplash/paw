# Webchat

Webchat is a built-in HTTP/WebSocket chat interface you can embed on your own website or access directly.

## Setup

1. In Pawz, go to **Settings → Channels**
2. Select **Webchat**
3. Configure:
   - **Port** — local port to listen on (default: 3000)
   - **DM policy** — open / allowlist / pairing
4. Start the channel

## Configuration

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Port | Yes | HTTP server port |
| DM policy | Yes | Who can chat |
| Allowed users | For allowlist | Usernames or IPs |

## Features

- Built-in chat UI accessible at `http://localhost:<port>`
- WebSocket for real-time streaming
- Per-user sessions with memory
- Prompt injection scanning
- Agent routing via channel routing rules

## Public access

To make webchat accessible outside your machine:

### Via Tailscale

```bash
tailscale serve https / http://localhost:3000
```

### Via Tailscale Funnel (public internet)

```bash
tailscale funnel 443 http://localhost:3000
```

See the [Tailscale guide](/guides/tailscale) for details.

## Embedding

You can embed the webchat in your website using an iframe:

```html
<iframe src="http://localhost:3000" width="400" height="600"></iframe>
```

## Tips

- Use pairing mode to require users to authenticate with a code
- Webchat is the simplest channel to get started with — no external accounts needed
- Combine with Tailscale for secure remote access
