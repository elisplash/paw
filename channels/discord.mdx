3. Go to **Bot** → create a bot → copy the token
4. Enable **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
5. Invite the bot to your server with the OAuth2 URL generator (scopes: `bot`, permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`)
6. In Pawz, go to **Settings → Channels**
7. Select **Discord**
8. Paste your bot token
9. Start the channel

## Configuration

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Bot token | Yes | From Discord Developer Portal |
| DM policy | Yes | Who can message the bot |
| Allowed users | For allowlist | Discord usernames |

## Features

- DMs and server channel messages
- Per-user sessions with memory
- Long messages auto-split for Discord's 2000 char limit
- Prompt injection scanning
- Agent routing via channel routing rules

## Routing

Route specific channels or users to different agents using routing rules:

- **Channel ID filter** — route messages from specific Discord channels
- **User filter** — route messages from specific users

## Tips

- Use `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in the Skills vault if you also want agents to send messages proactively via the Discord skill
- The bot responds to mentions and DMs by default
